  <h2 class='c005'>A WHITE HERON.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>I.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The woods were already filled with shadows
one June evening, just before eight
o’clock, though a bright sunset still glimmered
faintly among the trunks of the trees.
A little girl was driving home her cow, a
plodding, dilatory, provoking creature in
her behavior, but a valued companion for all
that. They were going away from the western
light, and striking deep into the dark
woods, but their feet were familiar with the
path, and it was no matter whether their
eyes could see it or not.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was hardly a night the summer
through when the old cow could be found
waiting at the pasture bars; on the contrary,
it was her greatest pleasure to hide herself
away among the high huckleberry bushes,
and though she wore a loud bell she had
made the discovery that if one stood perfectly
still it would not ring. So Sylvia had
to hunt for her until she found her, and call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Co’! Co’! with never an answering Moo,
until her childish patience was quite spent.
If the creature had not given good milk and
plenty of it, the case would have seemed
very different to her owners. Besides, Sylvia
had all the time there was, and very
little use to make of it. Sometimes in pleasant
weather it was a consolation to look
upon the cow’s pranks as an intelligent attempt
to play hide and seek, and as the child
had no playmates she lent herself to this
amusement with a good deal of zest. Though
this chase had been so long that the wary
animal herself had given an unusual signal
of her whereabouts, Sylvia had only laughed
when she came upon Mistress Moolly at the
swamp-side, and urged her affectionately
homeward with a twig of birch leaves. The
old cow was not inclined to wander farther,
she even turned in the right direction for
once as they left the pasture, and stepped
along the road at a good pace. She was
quite ready to be milked now, and seldom
stopped to browse. Sylvia wondered what
her grandmother would say because they
were so late. It was a great while since she
had left home at half past five o’clock, but
everybody knew the difficulty of making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>this errand a short one. Mrs. Tilley had
chased the hornéd torment too many summer
evenings herself to blame any one else
for lingering, and was only thankful as she
waited that she had Sylvia, nowadays, to
give such valuable assistance. The good
woman suspected that Sylvia loitered occasionally
on her own account; there never was
such a child for straying about out-of-doors
since the world was made! Everybody said
that it was a good change for a little maid
who had tried to grow for eight years in a
crowded manufacturing town, but, as for
Sylvia herself, it seemed as if she never had
been alive at all before she came to live at
the farm. She thought often with wistful
compassion of a wretched dry geranium that
belonged to a town neighbor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Afraid of folks,’” old Mrs. Tilley said
to herself, with a smile, after she had made
the unlikely choice of Sylvia from her
daughter’s houseful of children, and was returning
to the farm. “‘Afraid of folks,’
they said! I guess she won’t be troubled
no great with ’em up to the old place!”
When they reached the door of the lonely
house and stopped to unlock it, and the cat
came to purr loudly, and rub against them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>a deserted pussy, indeed, but fat with young
robins, Sylvia whispered that this was a
beautiful place to live in, and she never
should wish to go home.</p>

<p class='c012'>The companions followed the shady wood-road,
the cow taking slow steps, and the
child very fast ones. The cow stopped long
at the brook to drink, as if the pasture were
not half a swamp, and Sylvia stood still and
waited, letting her bare feet cool themselves
in the shoal water, while the great twilight
moths struck softly against her. She waded
on through the brook as the cow moved
away, and listened to the thrushes with a
heart that beat fast with pleasure. There
was a stirring in the great boughs overhead.
They were full of little birds and beasts that
seemed to be wide awake, and going about
their world, or else saying good-night to
each other in sleepy twitters. Sylvia herself
felt sleepy as she walked along. However,
it was not much farther to the house,
and the air was soft and sweet. She was not
often in the woods so late as this, and it
made her feel as if she were a part of the
gray shadows and the moving leaves. She
was just thinking how long it seemed since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>she first came to the farm a year ago, and
wondering if everything went on in the
noisy town just the same as when she was
there; the thought of the great red-faced
boy who used to chase and frighten her made
her hurry along the path to escape from the
shadow of the trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly this little woods-girl is horror-stricken
to hear a clear whistle not very far
away. Not a bird’s whistle, which would
have a sort of friendliness, but a boy’s whistle,
determined, and somewhat aggressive.
Sylvia left the cow to whatever sad fate
might await her, and stepped discreetly aside
into the bushes, but she was just too late.
The enemy had discovered her, and called
out in a very cheerful and persuasive tone,
“Halloa, little girl, how far is it to the
road?” and trembling Sylvia answered almost
inaudibly, “A good ways.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She did not dare to look boldly at the tall
young man, who carried a gun over his
shoulder, but she came out of her bush and
again followed the cow, while he walked
alongside.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have been hunting for some birds,”
the stranger said kindly, “and I have lost my
way, and need a friend very much. Don’t be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>afraid,” he added gallantly. “Speak up and
tell me what your name is, and whether you
think I can spend the night at your house,
and go out gunning early in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sylvia was more alarmed than before.
Would not her grandmother consider her
much to blame? But who could have foreseen
such an accident as this? It did not appear
to be her fault, and she hung her head
as if the stem of it were broken, but managed
to answer “Sylvy,” with much effort when
her companion again asked her name.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Tilley was standing in the doorway
when the trio came into view. The cow
gave a loud moo by way of explanation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, you’d better speak up for yourself,
you old trial! Where’d she tucked herself
away this time, Sylvy?” Sylvia kept an
awed silence; she knew by instinct that her
grandmother did not comprehend the gravity
of the situation. She must be mistaking
the stranger for one of the farmer-lads of
the region.</p>

<p class='c011'>The young man stood his gun beside the
door, and dropped a heavy game-bag beside
it; then he bade Mrs. Tilley good-evening,
and repeated his wayfarer’s story, and asked
if he could have a night’s lodging.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>“Put me anywhere you like,” he said.
“I must be off early in the morning, before
day; but I am very hungry, indeed. You
can give me some milk at any rate, that’s
plain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dear sakes, yes,” responded the hostess,
whose long slumbering hospitality seemed
to be easily awakened. “You might fare
better if you went out on the main road a
mile or so, but you’re welcome to what we’ve
got. I’ll milk right off, and you make yourself
at home. You can sleep on husks or
feathers,” she proffered graciously. “I
raised them all myself. There’s good pasturing
for geese just below here towards
the ma’sh. Now step round and set a plate
for the gentleman, Sylvy!” And Sylvia
promptly stepped. She was glad to have
something to do, and she was hungry herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a surprise to find so clean and comfortable
a little dwelling in this New England
wilderness. The young man had known
the horrors of its most primitive housekeeping,
and the dreary squalor of that level of
society which does not rebel at the companionship
of hens. This was the best thrift of
an old-fashioned farmstead, though on such
a small scale that it seemed like a hermitage.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>He listened eagerly to the old woman’s
quaint talk, he watched Sylvia’s pale face
and shining gray eyes with ever growing enthusiasm,
and insisted that this was the best
supper he had eaten for a month; then,
afterward, the new-made friends sat down in
the doorway together while the moon came
up.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon it would be berry-time, and Sylvia
was a great help at picking. The cow was
a good milker, though a plaguy thing to
keep track of, the hostess gossiped frankly,
adding presently that she had buried four
children, so that Sylvia’s mother, and a son
(who might be dead) in California were all
the children she had left. “Dan, my boy,
was a great hand to go gunning,” she explained
sadly. “I never wanted for pa’tridges
or gray squer’ls while he was to home. He’s
been a great wand’rer, I expect, and he’s no
hand to write letters. There, I don’t blame
him, I’d ha’ seen the world myself if it had
been so I could.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sylvia takes after him,” the grandmother
continued affectionately, after a minute’s
pause. “There ain’t a foot o’ ground
she don’t know her way over, and the wild
creatur’s counts her one o’ themselves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Squer’ls she’ll tame to come an’ feed right
out o’ her hands, and all sorts o’ birds. Last
winter she got the jay-birds to bangeing
here, and I believe she’d ‘a’ scanted herself
of her own meals to have plenty to throw
out amongst ’em, if I hadn’t kep’ watch.
Anything but crows, I tell her, I’m willin’
to help support, — though Dan he went an’
tamed one o’ them that did seem to have
reason same as folks. It was round here
a good spell after he went away. Dan an’
his father they didn’t hitch, — but he never
held up his head ag’in after Dan had dared
him an’ gone off.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The guest did not notice this hint of family
sorrows in his eager interest in something
else.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So Sylvy knows all about birds, does
she?” he exclaimed, as he looked round at
the little girl who sat, very demure but increasingly
sleepy, in the moonlight. “I am
making a collection of birds myself. I have
been at it ever since I was a boy.” (Mrs.
Tilley smiled.) “There are two or three
very rare ones I have been hunting for these
five years. I mean to get them on my own
ground if they can be found.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you cage ’em up?” asked Mrs. Tilley
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>doubtfully, in response to this enthusiastic
announcement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, they’re stuffed and preserved,
dozens and dozens of them,” said the ornithologist,
“and I have shot or snared
every one myself. I caught a glimpse of a
white heron three miles from here on Saturday,
and I have followed it in this direction.
They have never been found in this district
at all. The little white heron, it is,” and he
turned again to look at Sylvia with the hope
of discovering that the rare bird was one of
her acquaintances.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Sylvia was watching a hop-toad in
the narrow foot-path.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would know the heron if you saw
it,” the stranger continued eagerly. “A
queer tall white bird with soft feathers and
long thin legs. And it would have a nest
perhaps in the top of a high tree, made of
sticks, something like a hawk’s nest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sylvia’s heart gave a wild beat; she knew
that strange white bird, and had once stolen
softly near where it stood in some bright
green swamp grass, away over at the other
side of the woods. There was an open place
where the sunshine always seemed strangely
yellow and hot, where tall, nodding rushes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>grew, and her grandmother had warned her
that she might sink in the soft black mud
underneath and never be heard of more.
Not far beyond were the salt marshes and
beyond those was the sea, the sea which
Sylvia wondered and dreamed about, but
never had looked upon, though its great
voice could often be heard above the noise
of the woods on stormy nights.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t think of anything I should like
so much as to find that heron’s nest,” the
handsome stranger was saying. “I would
give ten dollars to anybody who could show
it to me,” he added desperately, “and I
mean to spend my whole vacation hunting
for it if need be. Perhaps it was only migrating,
or had been chased <a id='t11'></a>out of its own
region by some bird of prey.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Tilley gave amazed attention to all
this, but Sylvia still watched the toad, not
divining, as she might have done at some
calmer time, that the creature wished to
get to its hole under the doorstep, and was
much hindered by the unusual spectators at
that hour of the evening. No amount of
thought, that night, could decide how many
wished-for treasures the ten dollars, so
lightly spoken of, would buy.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>The next day the young sportsman hovered
about the woods, and Sylvia kept him
company, having lost her first fear of the
friendly lad, who proved to be most kind
and sympathetic. He told her many things
about the birds and what they knew and
where they lived and what they did with
themselves. And he gave her a jack-knife,
which she thought as great a treasure as if
she were a desert-islander. All day long he
did not once make her troubled or afraid
except when he brought down some unsuspecting
singing creature from its bough.
Sylvia would have liked him vastly better
without his gun; she could not understand
why he killed the very birds he seemed to
like so much. But as the day waned, Sylvia
still watched the young man with loving admiration.
She had never seen anybody so
charming and delightful; the woman’s heart,
asleep in the child, was vaguely thrilled by
a dream of love. Some premonition of that
great power stirred and swayed these young
foresters who traversed the solemn woodlands
with soft-footed silent care. They
stopped to listen to a bird’s song; they
pressed forward again eagerly, parting the
branches,—speaking to each other rarely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>and in whispers; the young man going first
and Sylvia following, fascinated, a few steps
behind, with her gray eyes dark with excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>She grieved because the longed-for white
heron was elusive, but she did not lead the
guest, she only followed, and there was no
such thing as speaking first. The sound of
her own unquestioned voice would have terrified
her,—it was hard enough to answer
yes or no when there was need of that. At
last evening began to fall, and they drove
the cow home together, and Sylvia smiled
with pleasure when they came to the place
where she heard the whistle and was afraid
only the night before.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>II.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Half a mile from home, at the farther
edge of the woods, where the land was highest,
a great pine-tree stood, the last of its
generation. Whether it was left for a boundary
mark, or for what reason, no one could
say; the woodchoppers who had felled its
mates were dead and gone long ago, and a
whole forest of sturdy trees, pines and oaks
and maples, had grown again. But the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>stately head of this old pine towered above
them all and made a landmark for sea and
shore miles and miles away. Sylvia knew
it well. She had always believed that whoever
climbed to the top of it could see the
ocean; and the little girl had often laid her
hand on the great rough trunk and looked
up wistfully at those dark boughs that the
wind always stirred, no matter how hot and
still the air might be below. Now she
thought of the tree with a new excitement,
for why, if one climbed it at break of day,
could not one see all the world, and easily
discover whence the white heron flew, and
mark the place, and find the hidden nest?</p>

<p class='c011'>What a spirit of adventure, what wild
ambition! What fancied triumph and delight
and glory for the later morning when
she could make known the secret! It was
almost too real and too great for the childish
heart to bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>All night the door of the little house stood
open, and the whippoorwills came and sang
upon the very step. The young sportsman
and his old hostess were sound asleep,
but Sylvia’s great design kept her broad
awake and watching. She forgot to think
of sleep. The short summer night seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>as long as the winter darkness, and at last
when the whippoorwills ceased, and she was
afraid the morning would after all come too
soon, she stole out of the house and followed
the pasture path through the woods, hastening
toward the open ground beyond, listening
with a sense of comfort and companionship
to the drowsy twitter of a half-awakened
bird, whose perch she had jarred in passing.
Alas, if the great wave of human interest
which flooded for the first time this dull little
life should sweep away the satisfactions
of an existence heart to heart with nature
and the dumb life of the forest!</p>

<p class='c011'>There was the huge tree asleep yet in the
paling moonlight, and small and hopeful Sylvia
began with utmost bravery to mount to
the top of it, with tingling, eager blood coursing
the channels of her whole frame, with
her bare feet and fingers, that pinched and
held like bird’s claws to the monstrous ladder
reaching up, up, almost to the sky itself.
First she must mount the white oak tree
that grew alongside, where she was almost
lost among the dark branches and the green
leaves heavy and wet with dew; a bird fluttered
off its nest, and a red squirrel ran to
and fro and scolded pettishly at the harmless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>housebreaker. Sylvia felt her way
easily. She had often climbed there, and
knew that higher still one of the oak’s upper
branches chafed against the pine trunk,
just where its lower boughs were set close
together. There, when she made the dangerous
pass from one tree to the other, the
great enterprise would really begin.</p>

<p class='c011'>She crept out along the swaying oak limb
at last, and took the daring step across into
the old pine-tree. The way was harder than
she thought; she must reach far and hold
fast, the sharp dry twigs caught and held
her and scratched her like angry talons, the
pitch made her thin little fingers clumsy and
stiff as she went round and round the tree’s
great stem, higher and higher upward.
The sparrows and robins in the woods below
were beginning to wake and twitter to
the dawn, yet it seemed much lighter there
aloft in the pine-tree, and the child knew
that she must hurry if her project were to
be of any use.</p>

<p class='c011'>The tree seemed to lengthen itself out as
she went up, and to reach farther and farther
upward. It was like a great main-mast
to the voyaging earth; it must truly have
been amazed that morning through all its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>ponderous frame as it felt this determined
spark of human spirit creeping and climbing
from higher branch to branch. Who
knows how steadily the least twigs held
themselves to advantage this light, weak
creature on her way! The old pine must
have loved his new dependent. More than
all the hawks, and bats, and moths, and
even the sweet-voiced thrushes, was the
brave, beating heart of the solitary gray-eyed
child. And the tree stood still and
held away the winds that June morning
while the dawn grew bright in the east.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sylvia’s face was like a pale star, if one
had seen it from the ground, when the last
thorny bough was past, and she stood trembling
and tired but wholly triumphant, high
in the tree-top. Yes, there was the sea with
the dawning sun making a golden dazzle
over it, and toward that glorious east flew
two hawks with slow-moving pinions. How
low they looked in the air from that height
when before one had only seen them far up,
and dark against the blue sky. Their gray
feathers were as soft as moths; they seemed
only a little way from the tree, and Sylvia
felt as if she too could go flying away among
the clouds. Westward, the woodlands and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>farms reached miles and miles into the distance;
here and there were church steeples,
and white villages; truly it was a vast and
awesome world.</p>

<p class='c011'>The birds sang louder and louder. At
last the sun came up bewilderingly bright.
Sylvia could see the white sails of ships out
at sea, and the clouds that were purple and
rose-colored and yellow at first began to fade
away. Where was the white heron’s nest in
the sea of green branches, and was this wonderful
sight and pageant of the world the
only reward for having climbed to such a
giddy height? Now look down again, Sylvia,
where the green marsh is set among the
shining birches and dark hemlocks; there
where you saw the white heron once you will
see him again; look, look! a white spot of
him like a single floating feather comes up
from the dead hemlock and grows larger,
and rises, and comes close at last, and goes
by the landmark pine with steady sweep of
wing and outstretched slender neck and
crested head. And wait! wait! do not
move a foot or a finger, little girl, do not
send an arrow of light and consciousness
from your two eager eyes, for the heron has
perched on a pine bough not far beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>yours, and cries back to his mate on the
nest, and plumes his feathers for the new
day!</p>

<p class='c011'>The child gives a long sigh a minute later
when a company of shouting cat-birds comes
also to the tree, and vexed by their fluttering
and lawlessness the solemn heron goes away.
She knows his secret now, the wild, light,
slender bird that floats and wavers, and
goes back like an arrow presently to his
home in the green world beneath. Then
Sylvia, well satisfied, makes her perilous
way down again, not daring to look far below
the branch she stands on, ready to cry
sometimes because her fingers ache and her
lamed feet slip. Wondering over and over
again what the stranger would say to her,
and what he would think when she told him
how to find his way straight to the heron’s
nest.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Sylvy, Sylvy!” called the busy old
grandmother again and again, but nobody
answered, and the small husk bed was empty,
and Sylvia had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>The guest waked from a dream, and remembering
his day’s pleasure hurried to
dress himself that it might sooner begin.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>He was sure from the way the shy little girl
looked once or twice yesterday that she had
at least seen the white heron, and now she
must really be persuaded to tell. Here she
comes now, paler than ever, and her worn
old frock is torn and tattered, and smeared
with pine pitch. The grandmother and the
sportsman stand in the door together and
question her, and the splendid moment has
come to speak of the dead hemlock-tree by
the green marsh.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Sylvia does not speak after all, though
the old grandmother fretfully rebukes her,
and the young man’s kind appealing eyes
are looking straight in her own. He can
make them rich with money; he has promised
it, and they are poor now. He is so well
worth making happy, and he waits to hear
the story she can tell.</p>

<p class='c011'>No, she must keep silence! What is it
that suddenly forbids her and makes her
dumb? Has she been nine years growing,
and now, when the great world for the first
time puts out a hand to her, must she thrust
it aside for a bird’s sake? The murmur of
the pine’s green branches is in her ears, she
remembers how the white heron came flying
through the golden air and how they watched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the sea and the morning together, and Sylvia
cannot speak; she cannot tell the heron’s
secret and give its life away.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dear loyalty, that suffered a sharp pang
as the guest went away disappointed later in
the day, that could have served and followed
him and loved him as a dog loves! Many
a night Sylvia heard the echo of his whistle
haunting the pasture path as she came home
with the loitering cow. She forgot even her
sorrow at the sharp report of his gun and
the piteous sight of thrushes and sparrows
dropping silent to the ground, their songs
hushed and their pretty feathers stained and
wet with blood. Were the birds better
friends than their hunter might have been,—who
can tell? Whatever treasures were
lost to her, woodlands and summer-time, remember!
Bring your gifts and graces and
tell your secrets to this lonely country child!</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>THE FLIGHT OF BETSEY LANE.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>I.</h3>

<p class='c010'>One windy morning in May, three old women
sat together near an open window in the
shed chamber of Byfleet Poor-house. The
wind was from the northwest, but their window
faced the southeast, and they were only
visited by an occasional pleasant waft of
fresh air. They were close together, knee
to knee, picking over a bushel of beans, and
commanding a view of the dandelion-starred,
green yard below, and of the winding, sandy
road that led to the village, two miles away.
Some captive bees were scolding among the
cobwebs of the rafters overhead, or thumping
against the upper panes of glass; two
calves were bawling from the barnyard,
where some of the men were at work loading
a dump-cart and shouting as if every one
were deaf. There was a cheerful feeling of
activity, and even an air of comfort, about
the Byfleet Poor-house. Almost every one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>was possessed of a most interesting past,
though there was less to be said about the
future. The inmates were by no means distressed
or unhappy; many of them retired
to this shelter only for the winter season, and
would go out presently, some to begin such
work as they could still do, others to live in
their own small houses; old age had impoverished
most of them by limiting their
power of endurance; but far from lamenting
the fact that they were town charges,
they rather liked the change and excitement
of a winter residence on the poor-farm.
There was a sharp-faced, hard-worked young
widow with seven children, who was an exception
to the general level of society, because
she deplored the change in her fortunes.
The older women regarded her with
suspicion, and were apt to talk about her in
moments like this, when they happened to
sit together at their work.</p>

<p class='c011'>The three bean-pickers were dressed alike
in stout brown ginghams, checked by a white
line, and all wore great faded aprons of blue
drilling, with sufficient pockets convenient
to the right hand. Miss Peggy Bond was a
very small, belligerent-looking person, who
wore a huge pair of steel-bowed spectacles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>holding her sharp chin well up in air, as if
to supplement an inadequate nose. She was
more than half blind, but the spectacles
seemed to face upward instead of square
ahead, as if their wearer were always on the
sharp lookout for birds. Miss Bond had
suffered much personal damage from time to
time, because she never took heed where she
planted her feet, and so was always tripping
and stubbing her bruised way through the
world. She had fallen down hatchways and
cellarways, and stepped composedly into deep
ditches and pasture brooks; but she was
proud of stating that she was upsighted, and
so was her father before her. At the poor-house,
where an unusual malady was considered
a distinction, upsightedness was looked
upon as a most honorable infirmity. Plain
rheumatism, such as afflicted Aunt Lavina
Dow, whose twisted hands found even this
light work difficult and tiresome,—plain
rheumatism was something of every-day occurrence,
and nobody cared to hear about it.
Poor Peggy was a meek and friendly soul,
who never put herself forward; she was just
like other folks, as she always loved to say,
but Mrs. Lavina Dow was a different sort of
person altogether, of great dignity and, occasionally,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>almost aggressive behavior. The
time had been when she could do a good
day’s work with anybody: but for many
years now she had not left the town-farm,
being too badly crippled to work; she had
no relations or friends to visit, but from an
innate love of authority she could not submit
to being one of those who are forgotten
by the world. Mrs. Dow was the hostess
and social lawgiver here, where she remembered
every inmate and every item of interest
for nearly forty years, besides an immense
amount of town history and biography for
three or four generations back.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was the dear friend of the third woman,
Betsey Lane; together they led thought and
opinion—chiefly opinion—and held
sway, not only over Byfleet Poor-farm, but
also the selectmen and all others in authority.
Betsey Lane had spent most of her life as
aid-in-general to the respected household of
old General Thornton. She had been much
trusted and valued, and, at the breaking up
of that once large and flourishing family, she
had been left in good circumstances, what
with legacies and her own comfortable savings;
but by sad misfortune and lavish generosity
everything had been scattered, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>after much illness, which ended in a stiffened
arm and more uncertainty, the good soul had
sensibly decided that it was easier for the
whole town to support her than for a part of
it. She had always hoped to see something
of the world before she died; she came of an
adventurous, seafaring stock, but had never
made a longer journey than to the towns
of Danby and Northville, thirty miles away.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were all old women; but Betsey
Lane, who was sixty-nine, and looked much
older, was the youngest. Peggy Bond was
far on in the seventies, and Mrs. Dow was
at least ten years older. She made a great
secret of her years; and as she sometimes
spoke of events prior to the Revolution with
the assertion of having been an eye-witness,
she naturally wore an air of vast antiquity.
Her tales were an inexpressible delight to
Betsey Lane, who felt younger by twenty
years because her friend and comrade was
so unconscious of chronological limitations.</p>

<p class='c011'>The bushel basket of cranberry beans was
within easy reach, and each of the pickers
had filled her lap from it again and again.
The shed chamber was not an unpleasant
place in which to sit at work, with its traces
of seed corn hanging from the brown crossbeams,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>its spare churns, and dusty loom, and
rickety wool-wheels, and a few bits of old
furniture. In one far corner was a wide
board of dismal use and suggestion, and close
beside it an old cradle. There was a battered
chest of drawers where the keeper of
the poor-house kept his garden-seeds, with
the withered remains of three seed cucumbers
ornamenting the top. Nothing beautiful
could be discovered, nothing interesting,
but there was something usable and homely
about the place. It was the favorite and untroubled
bower of the bean-pickers, to which
they might retreat unmolested from the public
apartments of this rustic institution.</p>

<p class='c011'>Betsey Lane blew away the chaff from her
handful of beans. The spring breeze blew
the chaff back again, and sifted it over her
face and shoulders. She rubbed it out of
her eyes impatiently, and happened to notice
old Peggy holding her own handful high, as
if it were an oblation, and turning her queer,
up-tilted head this way and that, to look at
the beans sharply, as if she were first cousin
to a hen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, Miss Bond, ’tis kind of botherin’
work for you, ain’t it?” Betsey inquired
compassionately.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“I feel to enjoy it, anything that I can
do my own way so,” responded Peggy. “I
like to do my part. Ain’t that old Mis’
Fales comin’ up the road? It sounds like
her step.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The others looked, but they were not farsighted,
and for a moment Peggy had the
advantage. Mrs. Fales was not a favorite.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hope she ain’t comin’ here to put up
this spring. I guess she won’t now, it’s gettin’
so late,” said Betsey Lane. “She likes
to go rovin’ soon as the roads is settled.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis Mis’ Fales!” said Peggy Bond, listening
with solemn anxiety. “There, do
let’s pray her by!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess she’s headin’ for her cousin’s
folks up Beech Hill way,” said Betsey presently.
“If she’d left her daughter’s this
mornin’, she’d have got just about as far as
this. I kind o’ wish she had stepped in
just to pass the time o’ day, long’s she wa’n’t
going to make no stop.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a silence as to further speech
in the shed chamber; and even the calves
were quiet in the barnyard. The men had
all gone away to the field where corn-planting
was going on. The beans clicked steadily
into the wooden measure at the pickers’ feet.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>Betsey Lane began to sing a hymn, and the
others joined in as best they might, like
autumnal crickets; their voices were sharp
and cracked, with now and then a few low
notes of plaintive tone. Betsey herself could
sing pretty well, but the others could only
make a kind of accompaniment. Their
voices ceased altogether at the higher notes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh my! I wish I had the means to go
to the Centennial,” mourned Betsey Lane,
stopping so suddenly that the others had to
go on croaking and shrilling without her for
a moment before they could stop. “It seems
to me as if I can’t die happy ‘less I do,” she
added; “I ain’t never seen nothin’ of the
world, an’ here I be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What if you was as old as I be?” suggested
Mrs. Dow pompously. “You’ve got
time enough yet, Betsey; don’t you go an’
despair. I knowed of a woman that went
clean round the world four times when she
was past eighty, an’ enjoyed herself real
well. Her folks followed the sea; she had
three sons an’ a daughter married,—all shipmasters,
and she’d been with her own husband
when they was young. She was left a
widder early, and fetched up her family herself,—a
real stirrin’, smart woman. After
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>they’d got married off, an’ settled, an’ was
doing well, she come to be lonesome; and
first she tried to stick it out alone, but she
wa’n’t one that could; an’ she got a notion
she hadn’t nothin’ before her but her last
sickness, and she wa’n’t a person that enjoyed
havin’ other folks do for her. So one
on her boys—I guess ’twas the oldest—said
he was going to take her to sea; there
was ample room, an’ he was sailin’ a good
time o’ year for the Cape o’ Good Hope an’
way up to some o’ them tea-ports in the
Chiny Seas. She was all high to go, but it
made a sight o’ talk at her age; an’ the
minister made it a subject o’ prayer the last
Sunday, and all the folks took a last leave;
but she said to some she’d fetch ’em home
something real pritty, and so did. An’ then
they come home t’other way, round the
Horn, an’ she done so well, an’ was such a
sight o’ company, the other child’n was
jealous, an’ she promised she’d go a v’y’ge
long o’ each on ’em. She was as sprightly
a person as ever I see; an’ could speak well
o’ what she’d seen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did she die to sea?” asked Peggy, with
interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, she died to home between v’y’ges,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>or she’d gone to sea again. I was to her
funeral. She liked her son George’s ship
the best; ’twas the one she was going on to
Callao. They said the men aboard all called
her ‘gran’ma’am,’ an’ she kep’ ’em mended
up, an’ would go below and tend to ’em if
they was sick. She might ‘a’ been alive an’
enjoyin’ of herself a good many years but
for the kick of a cow; ’twas a new cow out
of a drove, a dreadful unruly beast.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Dow stopped for breath, and reached
down for a new supply of beans; her empty
apron was gray with soft chaff. Betsey
Lane, still pondering on the Centennial, began
to sing another verse of her hymn, and
again the old women joined her. At this
moment some strangers came driving round
into the yard from the front of the house.
The turf was soft, and our friends did not
hear the horses’ steps. Their voices cracked
and quavered; it was a funny little concert,
and a lady in an open carriage just below
listened with sympathy and amusement.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>II.</h3>

<p class='c010'>“Betsey! Betsey! Miss Lane!” a voice
called eagerly at the foot of the stairs that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>led up from the shed. “Betsey! There’s
a lady here wants to see you right away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Betsey was dazed with excitement, like a
country child who knows the rare pleasure
of being called out of school. “Lor’, I ain’t
fit to go down, be I?” she faltered, looking
anxiously at her friends; but Peggy was
gazing even nearer to the zenith than usual,
in her excited effort to see down into the
yard, and Mrs. Dow only nodded somewhat
jealously, and said that she guessed ’twas
nobody would do her any harm. She rose
ponderously, while Betsey hesitated, being,
as they would have said, all of a twitter.
“It is a lady, certain,” Mrs. Dow assured
her; “’tain’t often there’s a lady comes
here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“While there was any of Mis’ Gen’ral
Thornton’s folks left, I wa’n’t without visits
from the gentry,” said Betsey Lane, turning
back proudly at the head of the stairs, with
a touch of old-world pride and sense of high
station. Then she disappeared, and closed
the door behind her at the stair-foot with a
decision quite unwelcome to the friends
above.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She needn’t ‘a’ been so dreadful ‘fraid
anybody was goin’ to listen. I guess we’ve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>got folks to ride an’ see us, or had once, if
we hain’t now,” said Miss Peggy Bond,
plaintively.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I expect ’twas only the wind shoved it
to,” said Aunt Lavina. “Betsey is one that
gits flustered easier than some. I wish
’twas somebody to take her off an’ give her
a kind of a good time; she’s young to settle
down ’long of old folks like us. Betsey’s
got a notion o’ rovin’ such as ain’t my natur’,
but I should like to see her satisfied.
She’d been a very understandin’ person, if
she had the advantages that some does.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis so,” said Peggy Bond, tilting her
chin high. “I suppose you can’t hear nothin’
they’re saying? I feel my hearin’ ain’t
up to whar it was. I can hear things close
to me well as ever; but there, hearin’ ain’t
everything; ’tain’t as if we lived where
there was more goin’ on to hear. Seems to
me them folks is stoppin’ a good while.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They surely be,” agreed Lavina Dow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I expect it’s somethin’ particular.
There ain’t none of the Thornton folks left,
except one o’ the gran’darters, an’ I’ve often I
heard Betsey remark that she should never
see her more, for she lives to London.
Strange how folks feels contented in them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>strayaway places off to the ends of the
airth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The flies and bees were buzzing against
the hot window-panes; the handfuls of beans
were clicking into the brown wooden measure.
A bird came and perched on the window-sill,
and then flitted away toward the
blue sky. Below, in the yard, Betsey Lane
stood talking with the lady. She had put
her blue drilling apron over her head, and
her face was shining with delight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lor’, dear,” she said, for at least the
third time, “I remember ye when I first see
ye; an awful pritty baby you was, an’ they
all said you looked just like the old gen’ral.
Be you goin’ back to foreign parts right
away?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I’m going back; you know that
all my children are there. I wish I could
take you with me for a visit,” said the
charming young guest. “I’m going to
carry over some of the pictures and furniture
from the old house; I didn’t care half
so much for them when I was younger as I
do now. Perhaps next summer we shall all
come over for a while. I should like to see
my girls and boys playing under the pines.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish you re’lly was livin’ to the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>place,” said Betsey Lane. Her imagination
was not swift; she needed time to think
over all that was being told her, and she
could not fancy the two strange houses
across the sea. The old Thornton house
was to her mind the most delightful and
elegant in the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is there anything I can do for you?”
asked Mrs. Strafford kindly,—“anything
that I can do for you myself, before I go
away? I shall be writing to you, and sending
some pictures of the children, and you
must let me know how you are getting on.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, there is one thing, darlin’. If you
could stop in the village an’ pick me out a
pritty, little, small lookin’-glass, that I can
keep for my own an’ have to remember you
by. ’Tain’t that I want to set me above the
rest o’ the folks, but I was always used to
havin’ my own when I was to your grandma’s.
There’s very nice folks here, some on ’em,
and I’m better off than if I was able to
keep house; but sence you ask me, that’s
the only thing I feel cropin’ about. What
be you goin’ right back for? ain’t you goin’
to see the great fair to Pheladelphy, that
everybody talks about?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” said Mrs. Strafford, laughing at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>this eager and almost convicting question.
“No; I’m going back next week. If I
were, I believe that I should take you with
me. Good-by, dear old Betsey; you make
me feel as if I were a little girl again; you
look just the same.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For full five minutes the old woman stood
out in the sunshine, dazed with delight, and
majestic with a sense of her own consequence.
She held something tight in her
hand, without thinking what it might be;
but just as the friendly mistress of the poor-farm
came out to hear the news, she tucked
the roll of money into the bosom of her
brown gingham dress. “’Twas my dear
Mis’ Katy Strafford,” she turned to say
proudly. “She come way over from London;
she’s been sick; they thought the voyage
would do her good. She said most the
first thing she had on her mind was to come
an’ find me, and see how I was, an’ if I was
comfortable; an’ now she ’s goin’ right back.
She’s got two splendid houses; an’ said
how she wished I was there to look after
things,—she remembered I was always her
gran’ma’s right hand. Oh, it does so carry
me back, to see her! Seems if all the rest
on ’em must be there together to the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>house. There, I must go right up an’ tell
Mis’ Dow an’ Peggy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dinner’s all ready; I was just goin’ to
blow the horn for the menfolks,” said the
keeper’s wife. “They’ll be right down. I
expect you’ve got along smart with them
beans,—all three of you together;” but
Betsey’s mind roved so high and so far at
that moment that no achievements of bean-picking
could lure it back.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>III.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The long table in the great kitchen soon
gathered its company of waifs and strays,—creatures
of improvidence and misfortune,
and the irreparable victims of old age. The
dinner was satisfactory, and there was not
much delay for conversation. Peggy Bond
and Mrs. Dow and Betsey Lane always sat
together at one end, with an air of putting
the rest of the company below the salt.
Betsey was still flushed with excitement; in
fact, she could not eat as much as usual, and
she looked up from time to time expectantly,
as if she were likely to be asked to speak of
her guest; but everybody was hungry, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>even Mrs. Dow broke in upon some attempted
confidences by asking inopportunely for a
second potato. There were nearly twenty
at the table, counting the keeper and his
wife and two children, noisy little persons
who had come from school with the small
flock belonging to the poor widow, who sat
just opposite our friends. She finished her
dinner before any one else, and pushed her
chair back; she always helped with the
housework,—a thin, sorry, bad-tempered-looking
poor soul, whom grief had sharpened
instead of softening. “I expect you feel too
fine to set with common folks,” she said enviously
to Betsey.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here I be a-settin’,” responded Betsey
calmly. “I don’ know’s I behave more unbecomin’
than usual.” Betsey prided herself
upon her good and proper manners; but
the rest of the company, who would have
liked to hear the bit of morning news, were
now defrauded of that pleasure. The wrong
note had been struck; there was a silence
after the clatter of knives and plates, and one
by one the cheerful town charges disappeared.
The bean-picking had been finished, and
there was a call for any of the women who
felt like planting corn; so Peggy Bond, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>could follow the line of hills pretty fairly,
and Betsey herself, who was still equal to
anybody at that work, and Mrs. Dow, all
went out to the field together. Aunt Lavina
labored slowly up the yard, carrying a
light splint-bottomed kitchen chair and her
knitting-work, and sat near the stone wall
on a gentle rise, where she could see the pond
and the green country, and exchange a word
with her friends as they came and went up
and down the rows. Betsey vouchsafed a
word now and then about Mrs. Strafford, but
you would have thought that she had been
suddenly elevated to Mrs. Strafford’s own
cares and the responsibilities attending them,
and had little in common with her old associates.
Mrs. Dow and Peggy knew well
that these high-feeling times never lasted
long, and so they waited with as much patience
as they could muster. They were by
no means without that true tact which is
only another word for unselfish sympathy.</p>

<p class='c011'>The strip of corn land ran along the side
of a great field; at the upper end of it was
a field-corner thicket of young maples and
walnut saplings, the children of a great nut-tree
that marked the boundary. Once, when
Betsey Lane found herself alone near this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>shelter at the end of her row, the other planters
having lagged behind beyond the rising
ground, she looked stealthily about, and then
put her hand inside her gown, and for the
first time took out the money that Mrs.
Strafford had given her. She turned it over
and over with an astonished look: there
were new bank-bills for a hundred dollars.
Betsey gave a funny little shrug of her
shoulders, came out of the bushes, and took
a step or two on the narrow edge of turf,
as if she were going to dance; then she hastily
tucked away her treasure, and stepped
discreetly down into the soft harrowed and
hoed land, and began to drop corn again,
five kernels to a hill. She had seen the top
of Peggy Bond’s head over the knoll, and
now Peggy herself came entirely into view,
gazing upward to the skies, and stumbling
more or less, but counting the corn by touch
and twisting her head about anxiously to
gain advantage over her uncertain vision.
Betsey made a friendly, inarticulate little
sound as they passed; she was thinking that
somebody said once that Peggy’s eyesight
might be remedied if she could go to Boston
to the hospital; but that was so remote and
impossible an undertaking that no one had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>ever taken the first step. Betsey Lane’s
brown old face suddenly worked with excitement,
but in a moment more she regained
her usual firm expression, and spoke carelessly
to Peggy as she turned and came
alongside.</p>

<p class='c011'>The high spring wind of the morning had
quite fallen; it was a lovely May afternoon.
The woods about the field to the northward
were full of birds, and the young leaves
scarcely hid the solemn shapes of a company
of crows that patiently attended the corn-planting,
Two of the men had finished
their hoeing, and were busy with the construction
of a scarecrow; they knelt in the
furrows, chuckling, and looking over some
forlorn, discarded garments. It was a time-honored
custom to make the scarecrow resemble
one of the poor-house family; and
this year they intended to have Mrs. Lavina
Dow protect the field in effigy; last year it
was the counterfeit of Betsey Lane who stood
on guard, with an easily recognized quilted
hood and the remains of a valued shawl
that one of the calves had found airing on
a fence and chewed to pieces. Behind the
men was the foundation for this rustic attempt
at statuary,—an upright stake and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>bar in the form of a cross. This stood on
the highest part of the field; and as the
men knelt near it, and the quaint figures of
the corn-planters went and came, the scene
gave a curious suggestion of foreign life.
It was not like New England; the presence
of the rude cross appealed strangely to the
imagination.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Life flowed so smoothly, for the most part,
at the Byfleet Poor-farm, that nobody knew
what to make, later in the summer, of a
strange disappearance. All the elder inmates
were familiar with illness and death,
and the poor pomp of a town-pauper’s funeral.
The comings and goings and the
various misfortunes of those who composed
this strange family, related only through its
disasters, hardly served for the excitement
and talk of a single day. Now that the
June days were at their longest, the old
people were sure to wake earlier than ever;
but one morning, to the astonishment of
every one, Betsey Lane’s bed was empty;
the sheets and blankets, which were her own,
and guarded with jealous care, were carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>folded and placed on a chair not too
near the window, and Betsey had flown.
Nobody had heard her go down the creaking
stairs. The kitchen door was unlocked,
and the old watch-dog lay on the step outside
in the early sunshine, wagging his tail
and looking wise, as if he were left on guard
and meant to keep the fugitive’s secret.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never knowed her to do nothin’ afore
’thout talking it over a fortnight, and paradin’
off when we could all see her,” ventured
a spiteful voice. “Guess we can wait
till night to hear ’bout it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Dow looked sorrowful and shook her
head. “Betsey had an aunt on her mother’s
side that went and drownded of herself;
she was a pritty-appearing woman as ever
you see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps she’s gone to spend the day
with Decker’s folks,” suggested Peggy Bond.
“She always takes an extra early start; she
was speakin’ lately o’ going up their way;”
but Mrs. Dow shook her head with a most
melancholy look. “I’m impressed that
something’s befell her,” she insisted. “I
heard her a-groanin’ in her sleep. I was
wakeful the forepart o’ the night,—’tis very
unusual with me, too.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“’Twa’n’t like Betsey not to leave us any
word,” said the other old friend, with more
resentment than melancholy. They sat together
almost in silence that morning in the
shed chamber. Mrs. Dow was sorting and
cutting rags, and Peggy braided them into
long ropes, to be made into mats at a later
date. If they had only known where Betsey
Lane had gone, they might have talked about
it until dinner-time at noon; but failing
this new subject, they could take no interest
in any of their old ones. Out in the field
the corn was well up, and the men were hoeing.
It was a hot morning in the shed
chamber, and the woolen rags were dusty
and hot to handle.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>V.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Byfleet people knew each other well, and
when this mysteriously absent person did
not return to the town-farm at the end of
a week, public interest became much excited;
and presently it was ascertained that
Betsey Lane was neither making a visit to
her friends the Deckers on Birch Hill, nor
to any nearer acquaintances; in fact, she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>disappeared altogether from her wonted
haunts. Nobody remembered to have seen
her pass, hers had been such an early flitting;
and when somebody thought of her having
gone away by train, he was laughed at for
forgetting that the earliest morning train
from South Byfleet, the nearest station, did
not start until long after eight o’clock; and
if Betsey had designed to be one of the
passengers, she would have started along the
road at seven, and been seen and known of
all women. There was not a kitchen in that
part of Byfleet that did not have windows
toward the road. Conversation rarely left
the level of the neighborhood gossip: to see
Betsey Lane, in her best clothes, at that hour
in the morning, would have been the signal
for much exercise of imagination; but as
day after day went by without news, the
curiosity of those who knew her best turned
slowly into fear, and at last Peggy Bond
again gave utterance to the belief that Betsey
had either gone out in the early morning
and put an end to her life, or that she had
gone to the Centennial. Some of the people
at table were moved to loud laughter,—it
was at supper-time on a Sunday night,—but
others listened with great interest.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“She never’d put on her good clothes to
drownd herself,” said the widow. “She
might have thought ’twas good as takin’ ’em
with her, though. Old folks has wandered
off an’ got lost in the woods afore now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Dow and Peggy resented this impertinent
remark, but deigned to take no
notice of the speaker. “She wouldn’t have
wore her best clothes to the Centennial,
would she?” mildly inquired Peggy, bobbing
her head toward the ceiling. “’Twould
be a shame to spoil your best things in such
a place. An’ I don’t know of her havin’
any money; there’s the end o’ that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’re bad as old Mis’ Bland, that used
to live neighbor to our folks,” said one of the
old men. “She was dreadful precise; an’
she so begretched to wear a good alapaca
dress that was left to her, that it hung in a
press forty year, an’ baited the moths at
last.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I often seen Mis’ Bland a-goin’ in to
meetin’ when I was a young girl,” said
Peggy Bond approvingly. “She was a
good-appearin’ woman, an’ she left property.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wish she’d left it to me, then,” said
the poor soul opposite, glancing at her pathetic
row of children: but it was not good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>manners at the farm to deplore one’s situation,
and Mrs. Dow and Peggy only frowned.
“Where do you suppose Betsey can be?”
said Mrs. Dow, for the twentieth time.
“She didn’t have no money. I know she
ain’t gone far, if it’s so that she’s yet alive.
She’s b’en real pinched all the spring.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps that lady that come one day
give her some,” the keeper’s wife suggested
mildly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then Betsey would have told me,” said
Mrs. Dow, with injured dignity.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>VI.</h3>

<p class='c010'>On the morning of her disappearance,
Betsey rose even before the pewee and the
English sparrow, and dressed herself quietly,
though with trembling hands, and stole out
of the kitchen door like a plunderless thief.
The old dog licked her hand and looked at
her anxiously; the tortoise-shell cat rubbed
against her best gown, and trotted away up
the yard, then she turned anxiously and
came after the old woman, following faithfully
until she had to be driven back.
Betsey was used to long country excursions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>afoot. She dearly loved the early morning;
and finding that there was no dew
to trouble her, she began to follow pasture
paths and short cuts across the fields, surprising
here and there a flock of sleepy
sheep, or a startled calf that rustled out from
the bushes. The birds were pecking their
breakfast from bush and turf; and hardly
any of the wild inhabitants of that rural
world were enough alarmed by her presence
to do more than flutter away if they chanced
to be in her path. She stepped along, light-footed
and eager as a girl, dressed in her
neat old straw bonnet and black gown, and
carrying a few belongings in her best bundle-handkerchief,
one that her only brother had
brought home from the East Indies fifty
years before. There was an old crow perched
as sentinel on a small, dead pine-tree, where
he could warn friends who were pulling up
the sprouted corn in a field close by; but he
only gave a contemptuous caw as the adventurer
appeared, and she shook her bundle
at him in revenge, and laughed to see him so
clumsy as he tried to keep his footing on the
twigs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I be,” she assured him. “I’m
a-goin’ to Pheladelphy, to the Centennial,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>same’s other folks. I’d jest as soon tell
ye’s not, old crow;” and Betsey laughed
aloud in pleased content with herself and
her daring, as she walked along. She had
only two miles to go to the station at South
Byfleet, and she felt for the money now and
then, and found it safe enough. She took
great pride in the success of her escape, and
especially in the long concealment of her
wealth. Not a night had passed since Mrs.
Strafford’s visit that she had not slept with
the roll of money under her pillow by night,
and buttoned safe inside her dress by day.
She knew that everybody would offer advice
and even commands about the spending or
saving of it; and she brooked no interference.</p>

<p class='c011'>The last mile of the foot-path to South
Byfleet was along the railway track; and
Betsey began to feel in haste, though it was
still nearly two hours to train time. She
looked anxiously forward and back along the
rails every few minutes, for fear of being run
over; and at last she caught sight of an
engine that was apparently coming toward
her, and took flight into the woods before
she could gather courage to follow the path
again. The freight train proved to be at a
standstill, waiting at a turnout; and some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>of the men were straying about, eating their
early breakfast comfortably in this time of
leisure. As the old woman came up to them,
she stopped too, for a moment of rest and
conversation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where be ye goin’?” she asked pleasantly;
and they told her. It was to the
town where she had to change cars and take
the great through train; a point of geography
which she had learned from evening talks
between the men at the farm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’ll ye carry me there for?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We don’t run no passenger cars,” said
one of the young fellows, laughing. “What
makes you in such a hurry?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m startin’ for Pheladelphy, an’ it’s a
gre’t ways to go.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So ’tis; but you’re consid’able early,
if you’re makin’ for the eight-forty train.
See here! you haven’t got a needle an’
thread ’long of you in that bundle, have
you? If you’ll sew me on a couple o’ buttons,
I’ll give ye a free ride. I’m in a
sight o’ distress, an’ none o’ the fellows is
provided with as much as a bent pin.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You poor boy! I’ll have you seen to,
in half a minute. I’m troubled with a stiff
arm, but I’ll do the best I can.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>The obliging Betsey seated herself stiffly
on the slope of the embankment, and found
her thread and needle with utmost haste.
Two of the train-men stood by and watched
the careful stitches, and even offered her a
place as spare brakeman, so that they might
keep her near; and Betsey took the offer
with considerable seriousness, only thinking
it necessary to assure them that she was
getting most too old to be out in all weathers.
An express went by like an earthquake,
and she was presently hoisted on
board an empty box-car by two of her new
and flattering acquaintances, and found herself
before noon at the end of the first
stage of her journey, without having spent
a cent, and furnished with any amount of
thrifty advice. One of the young men, being
compassionate of her unprotected state
as a traveler, advised her to find out the
widow of an uncle of his in Philadelphia,
saying despairingly that he couldn’t tell her
just how to find the house; but Miss Betsey
Lane said that she had an English
tongue in her head, and should be sure to
find whatever she was looking for. This
unexpected incident of the freight train
was the reason why everybody about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>South Byfleet station insisted that no such
person had taken passage by the regular
train that same morning, and why there
were those who persuaded themselves that
Miss Betsey Lane was probably lying at
the bottom of the poor-farm pond.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>VII.</h3>

<p class='c010'>“Land sakes!” said Miss Betsey Lane,
as she watched a Turkish person parading
by in his red fez, “I call the Centennial
somethin’ like the day o’ judgment! I wish
I was goin’ to stop a month, but I dare say
’twould be the death o’ my poor old bones.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She was leaning against the barrier of a
patent pop-corn establishment, which had
given her a sudden reminder of home, and
of the winter nights when the sharp-kerneled
little red and yellow ears were brought out,
and Old Uncle Eph Flanders sat by the
kitchen stove, and solemnly filled a great
wooden chopping-tray for the refreshment
of the company. She had wandered and
loitered and looked until her eyes and
head had grown numb and unreceptive; but
it is only unimaginative persons who can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>be really astonished. The imagination can
always outrun the possible and actual sights
and sounds of the world; and this plain old
body from Byfleet rarely found anything
rich and splendid enough to surprise her.
She saw the wonders of the West and the
splendors of the East with equal calmness
and satisfaction; she had always known
that there was an amazing world outside
the boundaries of Byfleet. There was a
piece of paper in her pocket on which was
marked, in her clumsy handwriting, “If
Betsey Lane should meet with accident, notify
the selectmen of Byfleet;” but having
made this slight provision for the future,
she had thrown herself boldly into the sea of
strangers, and then had made the joyful
discovery that friends were to be found at
every turn.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was something delightfully companionable
about Betsey; she had a way of
suddenly looking up over her big spectacles
with a reassuring and expectant smile, as if
you were going to speak to her, and you
generally did. She must have found out
where hundreds of people came from, and
whom they had left at home, and what they
thought of the great show, as she sat on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>bench to rest, or leaned over the railings
where free luncheons were afforded by the
makers of hot waffles and molasses candy
and fried potatoes; and there was not a
night when she did not return to her lodgings
with a pocket crammed with samples of
spool cotton and nobody knows what. She
had already collected small presents for almost
everybody she knew at home, and she
was such a pleasant, beaming old country
body, so unmistakably appreciative and interested,
that nobody ever thought of wishing
that she would move on. Nearly all the
busy people of the Exhibition called her
either Aunty or Grandma at once, and made
little pleasures for her as best they could.
She was a delightful contrast to the indifferent,
stupid crowd that drifted along, with
eyes fixed at the same level, and seeing,
even on that level, nothing for fifty feet at a
time. “What be you making here, dear?”
Betsey Lane would ask joyfully, and the
most perfunctory guardian hastened to explain.
She squandered money as she had
never had the pleasure of doing before, and
this hastened the day when she must return
to Byfleet. She was always inquiring if
there were any spectacle-sellers at hand, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>received occasional directions; but it was a
difficult place for her to find her way about
in, and the very last day of her stay arrived
before she found an exhibitor of the desired
sort, an oculist and instrument-maker.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I called to get some specs for a friend
that’s upsighted,” she gravely informed the
salesman, to his extreme amusement. “She’s
dreadful troubled, and jerks her head up
like a hen a-drinkin’. She’s got a blur
a-growin’ an’ spreading an’ sometimes she
can see out to one side on ’t, and more times
she can’t.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Cataracts,” said a middle-aged gentleman
at her side; and Betsey Lane turned
to regard him with approval and curiosity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis Miss Peggy Bond I was mentioning,
of Byfleet Poor-farm,” she explained.
“I count on gettin’ some glasses to relieve
her trouble, if there ’s any to be found.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Glasses won’t do her any good,” said
the stranger. “Suppose you come and sit
down on this bench, and tell me all about it.
First, where is Byfleet?” and Betsey gave
the directions at length.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought so,” said the surgeon. “How
old is this friend of yours?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Betsey cleared her throat decisively, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>smoothed her gown over her knees as if it
were an apron; then she turned to take a
good look at her new acquaintance as they
sat on the rustic bench together. “Who be
you, sir, I should like to know?” she asked,
in a friendly tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My name’s Dunster.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I take it you’re a doctor,” continued
Betsey, as if they had overtaken each other
walking from Byfleet to South Byfleet on a
summer morning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m a doctor; part of one at least,”
said he. “I know more or less about eyes;
and I spend my summers down on the shore
at the mouth of your river; some day I’ll
come up and look at this person. How old
is she?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Peggy Bond is one that never tells her
age; ’tain’t come quite up to where she’ll
begin to brag of it, you see,” explained
Betsey reluctantly; “but I know her to
be nigh to seventy-six, one way or t’other.
Her an’ Mrs. Mary Ann Chick was same
year’s child’n, and Peggy knows I know it,
an’ two or three times when we’ve be’n in
the buryin’-ground where Mary Ann lays
an’ has her dates right on her headstone,
I couldn’t bring Peggy to take no sort o’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>notice. I will say she makes, at times, a
convenience of being upsighted. But there,
I feel for her,—everybody does; it keeps
her stubbin’ an’ trippin’ against everything,
beakin’ and gazin’ up the way she has to.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes,” said the doctor, whose eyes
were twinkling. “I’ll come and look after
her, with your town doctor, this summer,—some
time in the last of July or first of August.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll find occupation,” said Betsey, not
without an air of patronage. “Most of us
to the Byfleet Farm has got our ails, now I
tell ye. You ain’t got no bitters that’ll
take a dozen years right off an ol’ lady’s
shoulders?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The busy man smiled pleasantly, and
shook his head as he went away. “Dunster,”
said Betsey to herself, soberly committing
the new name to her sound memory.
“Yes, I mustn’t forget to speak of him to
the doctor, as he directed. I do’ know now
as Peggy would vally herself quite so much
accordin’ to, if she had her eyes fixed same
as other folks. I expect there wouldn’t
been a smarter woman in town, though, if
she’d had a proper chance. Now I’ve done
what I set to do for her, I do believe, an’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>’twa’n’t glasses, neither. I’ll git her a
pritty little shawl with that money I laid
aside. Peggy Bond ain’t got a pritty shawl.
I always wanted to have a real good time,
an’ now I’m havin’ it.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>VIII.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Two or three days later, two pathetic figures
might have been seen crossing the
slopes of the poor-farm field, toward the low
shores of Byfield pond. It was early in the
morning, and the stubble of the lately mown
grass was wet with rain and hindering to
old feet. Peggy Bond was more blundering
and liable to stray in the wrong direction
than usual; it was one of the days when she
could hardly see at all. Aunt Lavina Dow
was unusually clumsy of movement, and
stiff in the joints; she had not been so far
from the house for three years. The morning
breeze filled the gathers of her wide
gingham skirt, and aggravated the size of
her unwieldy figure. She supported herself
with a stick, and trusted beside to the
fragile support of Peggy’s arm. They were
talking together in whispers.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>“Oh, my sakes!” exclaimed Peggy, moving
her small head from side to side. “Hear
you wheeze, Mis’ Dow! This may be the
death o’ you; there, do go slow! You set
here on the side-hill, an’ le’ me go try if I
can see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It needs more eyesight than you’ve
got,” said Mrs. Dow, panting between the
words. “Oh! to think how spry I was in
my young days, an’ here I be now, the full
of a door, an’ all my complaints so aggravated
by my size. ’Tis hard! ’tis hard!
but I’m a-doin’ of all this for pore Betsey’s
sake. I know they’ve all laughed, but I
look to see her ris’ to the top o’ the pond
this day,—’tis just nine days since she
departed; an’ say what they may, I know
she hove herself in. It run in her family;
Betsey had an aunt that done just so, an’
she ain’t be’n like herself, a-broodin’ an’
hivin’ away alone, an’ nothin’ to say to you
an’ me that was always sich good company
all together. Somethin’ sprung her mind,
now I tell ye, Mis’ Bond.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I feel to hope we sha’n’t find her, I
must say,” faltered Peggy. It was plain
that Mrs. Dow was the captain of this doleful
expedition. “I guess she ain’t never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>thought o’ drowndin’ of herself, Mis’ Dow;
she’s gone off a-visitin’ way over to the
other side o’ South Byfleet; some thinks
she’s gone to the Centennial even now!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She hadn’t no proper means, I tell ye,”
wheezed Mrs. Dow indignantly; “an’ if
you prefer that others should find her
floatin’ to the top this day, instid of us
that’s her best friends, you can step back
to the house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They walked on in aggrieved silence.
Peggy Bond trembled with excitement, but
her companion’s firm grasp never wavered,
and so they came to the narrow, gravelly
margin and stood still. Peggy tried in vain
to see the glittering water and the pond-lilies
that starred it; she knew that they
must be there; once, years ago, she had
caught fleeting glimpses of them, and she
never forgot what she had once seen. The
clear blue sky overhead, the dark pine-woods
beyond the pond, were all clearly pictured in
her mind. “Can’t you see nothin’?” she
faltered; “I believe I’m wuss’n upsighted
this day. I’m going to be blind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” said Lavina Dow solemnly; “no,
there ain’t nothin’ whatever, Peggy. I hope
to mercy she ain’t”—</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“Why, whoever’d expected to find you
’way out here!” exclaimed a brisk and
cheerful voice. There stood Betsey Lane
herself, close behind them, having just
emerged from a thicket of alders that grew
close by. She was following the short way
homeward from the railroad.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what’s the matter, Mis’ Dow?
You ain’t overdoin’, be ye? an’ Peggy’s all
of a flutter. What in the name o’ natur’
ails ye?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There ain’t nothin’ the matter, as I
knows on,” responded the leader of this
fruitless expedition. “We only thought
we’d take a stroll this pleasant mornin’,”
she added, with sublime self-possession.
“Where’ve you be’n, Betsey Lane?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Pheladelphy, ma’am,” said Betsey,
looking quite young and gay, and wearing
a townish and unfamiliar air that upheld
her words. “All ought to go that can;
why, you feel’s if you’d be’n all round the
world. I guess I’ve got enough to think of
and tell ye for the rest o’ my days. I’ve
always wanted to go somewheres. I wish
you’d be’n there, I do so. I’ve talked
with folks from Chiny an’ the back o’ Pennsylvany;
and I see folks way from Australy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>that ’peared as well as anybody; an’ I see how
they made spool cotton, an’ sights o’ other
things; an’ I spoke with a doctor that lives
down to the beach in the summer, an’ he
offered to come up ’long in the first of
August, an’ see what he can do for Peggy’s
eyesight. There was di’monds there as big
as pigeon’s eggs; an’ I met with Mis’ Abby
Fletcher from South Byfleet depot; an’
there was hogs there that weighed risin’
thirteen hunderd”—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want to know,” said Mrs. Lavina Dow
and Peggy Bond, together.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, ’twas a great exper’ence for a
person,” added Lavina, turning ponderously,
in spite of herself, to give a last wistful look
at the smiling waters of the pond.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know how soon I be goin’ to
settle down,” proclaimed the rustic sister of
Sindbad. “What’s for the good o’ one’s
for the good of all. You just wait till we’re
setting together up in the old shed chamber!
You know, my dear Mis’ Katy Strafford
give me a han’some present o’ money that
day she come to see me; and I’d be’n
a-dreamin’ by night an’ day o’ seein’ that
Centennial; and when I come to think on ’t
I felt sure somebody ought to go from this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>neighborhood, if ’twas only for the good
o’ the rest; and I thought I’d better be the
one. I wa’n’t goin’ to ask the selec’men
neither. I’ve come back with one-thirty-five
in money, and I see everything there,
an’ I fetched ye all a little somethin’; but
I’m full o’ dust now, an’ pretty nigh beat
out. I never see a place more friendly
than Pheladelphy; but ’tain’t natural to
a Byfleet person to be always walkin’ on a
level. There, now, Peggy, you take my
bundle-handkercher and the basket, and let
Mis’ Dow sag on to me. I’ll git her along
twice as easy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>With this the small elderly company set
forth triumphant toward the poor-house,
across the wide green field.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE DULHAM LADIES.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>To be leaders of society in the town of
Dulham was as satisfactory to Miss Dobin
and Miss Lucinda Dobin as if Dulham were
London itself. Of late years, though they
would not allow themselves to suspect such
treason, the most ill-bred of the younger
people in the village made fun of them behind
their backs, and laughed at their treasured
summer mantillas, their mincing steps,
and the shape of their parasols.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were always conscious of the fact
that they were the daughters of a once eminent
Dulham minister; but beside this unanswerable
claim to the respect of the First
Parish, they were aware that their mother’s
social position was one of superior altitude.
Madam Dobin’s grandmother was a Greenaple
of Boston. In her younger days she had
often visited her relatives, the Greenaples
and Hightrees, and in seasons of festivity
she could relate to a select and properly
excited audience her delightful experiences
of town life. Nothing could be finer than
her account of having taken tea at Governor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Clovenfoot’s, on Beacon Street, in company
with an English lord, who was indulging
himself in a brief vacation from his arduous
duties at the Court of St. James.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He exclaimed that he had seldom seen
in England so beautiful and intelligent a
company of ladies,” Madam Dobin would
always say in conclusion. “He was decorated
with the blue ribbon of the Knights of
the Garter.” Miss Dobin and Miss Lucinda
thought for many years that this famous
blue ribbon was tied about the noble
gentleman’s leg. One day they even discussed
the question openly; Miss Dobin placing
the decoration at his knee, and Miss Lucinda
locating it much lower down, according
to the length of the short gray socks with
which she was familiar.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have no imagination, Lucinda,”
the elder sister replied impatiently. “Of
course, those were the days of small-clothes
and long silk stockings!”—whereat Miss
Lucinda was rebuked, but not persuaded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish that my dear girls could have
the outlook upon society which fell to my
portion,” Madam Dobin sighed, after she
had set these ignorant minds to rights, and
enriched them by communicating the final
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>truth about the blue ribbon. “I must not
chide you for the absence of opportunities,
but if our cousin Harriet Greenaple were
only living, you would not lack enjoyment or
social education.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Madam Dobin had now been dead a great
many years. She seemed an elderly woman
to her daughters some time before she left
them; they thought later that she had really
died comparatively young, since their own
years had come to equal the record of hers.
When they visited her tall white tombstone
in the orderly Dulham burying-ground, it
was a strange thought to both the daughters
that they were older women than their
mother had been when she died. To be sure,
it was the fashion to appear older in her day,—they
could remember the sober effect of
really youthful married persons in cap and
frisette; but, whether they owed it to the
changed times or to their own qualities, they
felt no older themselves than ever they had.
Beside upholding the ministerial dignity of
their father, they were obliged to give a
lenient sanction to the ways of the world for
their mother’s sake; and they combined the
two duties with reverence and impartiality.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Madam Dobin was, in her prime, a walking
example of refinement and courtesy. If
she erred in any way, it was by keeping too
strict watch and rule over her small kingdom.
She acted with great dignity in all
matters of social administration and etiquette,
but, while it must be owned that the
parishioners felt a sense of freedom for a
time after her death, in their later years
they praised and valued her more and more,
and often lamented her generously and
sincerely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Several of her distinguished relatives attended
Madam Dobin’s funeral, which was
long considered the most dignified and elegant
pageant of that sort which had ever
taken place in Dulham. It seemed to mark
the close of a famous epoch in Dulham history,
and it was increasingly difficult forever
afterward to keep the tone of society up to
the old standard. Somehow, the distinguished
relatives had one by one disappeared,
though they all had excellent reasons
for the discontinuance of their visits.
A few had left this world altogether, and
the family circle of the Greenaples and
Hightrees was greatly reduced in circumference.
Sometimes, in summer, a stray connection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>drifted Dulham-ward, and was displayed
to the townspeople (not to say paraded)
by the gratified hostesses. It was a
disappointment if the guest could not be
persuaded to remain over Sunday and appear
at church. When household antiquities
became fashionable, the ladies remarked
upon a surprising interest in their corner
cupboard and best chairs, and some distant
relatives revived their almost forgotten custom
of paying a summer visit to Dulham.
They were not long in finding out with what
desperate affection Miss Dobin and Miss
Lucinda clung to their mother’s wedding
china and other inheritances, and were allowed
to depart without a single teacup.
One graceless descendant of the Hightrees
prowled from garret to cellar, and admired
the household belongings diligently, but she
was not asked to accept even the dislocated
cherry-wood footstool that she had discovered
in the far corner of the parsonage pew.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some of the Dulham friends had always
suspected that Madam Dobin made a social
misstep when she chose the Reverend Edward
Dobin for her husband. She was no
longer young when she married, and though
she had gone through the wood and picked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>up a crooked stick at last, it made a great difference
that her stick possessed an ecclesiastical
bark. The Reverend Edward was,
moreover, a respectable graduate of Harvard
College, and to a woman of her standards a
clergyman was by no means insignificant.
It was impossible not to respect his office,
at any rate, and she must have treated him
with proper veneration for the sake of that,
if for no other reason, though his early advantages
had been insufficient, and he was
quite insensible to the claims of the Greenaple
pedigree, and preferred an Indian pudding
to pie crust that was, without exaggeration,
half a quarter high. The delicacy
of Madam Dobin’s touch and preference in
everything, from hymns to cookery, was
quite lost upon this respected preacher, yet
he was not without pride or complete confidence
in his own decisions.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Reverend Mr. Dobin was never very
enlightening in his discourses, and was providentially
stopped short by a stroke of paralysis
in the middle of his clerical career. He
lived on and on through many dreary years,
but his children never accepted the fact that
he was a tyrant, and served him humbly and
patiently. He fell at last into a condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>of great incapacity and chronic trembling,
but was able for nearly a quarter of a century
to be carried to the meeting-house from
time to time to pronounce farewell discourses.
On high days of the church he was
always placed in the pulpit, and held up
his shaking hands when the benediction was
pronounced, as if the divine gift were exclusively
his own, and the other minister did
but say empty words. Afterward he was
usually tired and displeased and hard to
cope with, but there was always a proper
notice taken of these too often recurring
events. For old times’ and for pity’s sake
and from natural goodness of heart, the
elder parishioners rallied manfully about the
Reverend Mr. Dobin; and whoever his successor
or colleague might be, the Dobins
were always called the minister’s folks, while
the active laborer in that vineyard was
only Mr. Smith or Mr. Jones, as the case
might be. At last the poor old man died,
to everybody’s relief and astonishment; and
after he was properly preached about and
lamented, his daughters, Miss Dobin and
Miss Lucinda, took a good look at life from
a new standpoint, and decided that, now
they were no longer constrained by home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>duties, they must make themselves of a
great deal more use to the town.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sometimes there is such a household as
this (which has been perhaps too minutely
described), where the parents linger until
their children are far past middle age, and
always keep them in a too childish and
unworthy state of subjection. The Misses
Dobin’s characters were much influenced by
such an unnatural prolongation of the filial
relationship, and they were amazingly slow
to suspect that they were not so young as
they used to be. There was nothing to
measure themselves by but Dulham people
and things. The elm-trees were growing
yet, and many of the ladies of the First Parish
were older than they, and called them,
with pleasant familiarity, the Dobin girls.
These elderly persons seemed really to be
growing old, and Miss Lucinda frequently
lamented the change in society; she thought
it a freak of nature and too sudden blighting
of earthly hopes that several charming old
friends of her mother’s were no longer living.
They were advanced in age when Miss Lucinda
was a young girl, though time and
space are but relative, after all.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their influence upon society would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>made a great difference in many ways. Certainly,
the new parishioners, who had often
enough been instructed to pronounce their
pastor’s name as if it were spelled with one
“b,” would not have boldly returned again
and again to their obnoxious habit of saying
Dobbin. Miss Lucinda might carefully
speak to the neighbor and new-comers of
“my sister, Miss Do-bin;” only the select
company of intimates followed her lead, and
at last there was something humiliating
about it, even though many persons spoke
of them only as “the ladies.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The name was originally <em>D’Aubigne</em>,
we think,” Miss Lucinda would say coldly
and patiently, as if she had already explained
this foolish mistake a thousand
times too often. It was like the sorrows in
many a provincial château in the Reign of
Terror. The ladies looked on with increasing
dismay at the retrogression in society.
They felt as if they were a feeble garrison,
to whose lot it had fallen to repulse a noisy,
irreverent mob, an increasing band of marauders
who would overthrow all landmarks
of the past, all etiquette and social rank.
The new minister himself was a round-faced,
unspiritual-looking young man, whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>they would have instinctively ignored if he
had not been a minister. The new people
who came to Dulham were not like the older
residents, and they had no desire to be
taught better. Little they cared about the
Greenaples or the Hightrees; and once, when
Miss Dobin essayed to speak of some detail
of her mother’s brilliant experiences in Boston
high life, she was interrupted, and the
new-comer who sat next her at the parish
sewing society began to talk about something
else. We cannot believe that it could
have been the tea-party at Governor Clovenfoot’s
which the rude creature so disrespectfully
ignored, but some persons are capable
of showing any lack of good taste.</p>

<p class='c011'>The ladies had an unusual and most painful
sense of failure, as they went home together
that evening. “I have always made
it my object to improve and interest the
people at such times; it would seem so possible
to elevate their thoughts and direct
them into higher channels,” said Miss Dobin
sadly. “But as for that Woolden woman,
there is no use in casting pearls before
swine!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Lucinda murmured an indignant assent.
She had a secret suspicion that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Woolden woman had heard the story in
question oftener than had pleased her. She
was but an ignorant creature; though she
had lived in Dulham twelve or thirteen
years, she was no better than when she came.
The mistake was in treating sister Harriet
as if she were on a level with the rest of
the company. Miss Lucinda had observed
more than once, lately, that her sister sometimes
repeated herself, unconsciously, a little
oftener than was agreeable. Perhaps they
were getting a trifle dull; towards spring it
might be well to pass a few days with some
of their friends, and have a change.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If I have tried to do anything,” said
Miss Dobin in an icy tone, “it has been to
stand firm in my lot and place, and to hold
the standard of cultivated mind and elegant
manners as high as possible. You would
think it had been a hundred years since our
mother’s death, so completely has the effect
of her good breeding and exquisite hospitality
been lost sight of, here in Dulham. I
could wish that our father had chosen to settle
in a larger and more appreciative place.
They would like to put us on the shelf, too.
I can see that plainly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sure we have our friends,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Miss Lucinda anxiously, but with a choking
voice. “We must not let them think we do
not mean to keep up with the times, as we
always have. I do feel as if perhaps—our
hair”—</p>

<p class='c011'>And the sad secret was out at last. Each
of the sisters drew a long breath of relief at
this beginning of a confession.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was certain that they must take some
steps to retrieve their lost ascendency. Public
attention had that evening been called
to their fast-disappearing locks, poor ladies;
and Miss Lucinda felt the discomfort most,
for she had been the inheritor of the Hightree
hair, long and curly, and chestnut in
color. There used to be a waviness about
it, and sometimes pretty escaping curls, but
these were gone long ago. Miss Dobin resembled
her father, and her hair had not
been luxuriant, so that she was less changed
by its absence than one might suppose. The
straightness and thinness had increased so
gradually that neither sister had quite accepted
the thought that other persons would
particularly notice their altered appearance.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had shrunk, with the reticence born
of close family association, from speaking of
the cause even to each other, when they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>made themselves pretty little lace and dotted
muslin caps. Breakfast caps, they called
them, and explained that these were universally
worn in town; the young Princess of
Wales originated them, or at any rate
adopted them. The ladies offered no apology
for keeping the breakfast caps on until
bedtime, and in spite of them a forward
child had just spoken, loud and shrill, an
untimely question in the ears of the for once
silent sewing society. “Do Miss Dobinses
wear them great caps because their heads is
cold?” the little beast had said; and everybody
was startled and dismayed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Dobin had never shown better her
good breeding and valor, the younger sister
thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, little girl,” replied the stately Harriet,
with a chilly smile. “I believe that
our headdresses are quite in the fashion for
ladies of all ages. And you must remember
that it is never polite to make such personal
remarks.” It was after this that Miss Dobin
had been reminded of Madam Somebody’s
unusual headgear at the evening entertainment
in Boston. Nobody but the
Woolden woman could have interrupted her
under such trying circumstances.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Miss Lucinda, however, was certain that
the time had come for making some effort
to replace her lost adornment. The child
had told an unwelcome truth, but had paved
the way for further action, and now was the
time to suggest something that had slowly
been taking shape in Miss Lucinda’s mind.
A young grand-nephew of their mother and
his bride had passed a few days with them,
two or three summers before, and the sisters
had been quite shocked to find that the
pretty young woman wore a row of frizzes,
not originally her own, over her smooth
forehead. At the time, Miss Dobin and
Miss Lucinda had spoken severely with each
other of such bad taste, but now it made a
great difference that the wearer of the
frizzes was not only a relative by marriage
and used to good society, but also that she
came from town, and might be supposed to
know what was proper in the way of toilet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I really think, sister, that we had better
see about having some—arrangements, next
time we go anywhere,” Miss Dobin said unexpectedly,
with a slight tremble in her
voice, just as they reached their own door.
“There seems to be quite a fashion for them
nowadays. For the parish’s sake we ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>to recognize”—and Miss Lucinda responded
with instant satisfaction. She did
not like to complain, but she had been
troubled with neuralgic pains in her forehead
on suddenly meeting the cold air. The
sisters felt a new bond of sympathy in keeping
this secret with and for each other; they
took pains to say to several acquaintances
that they were thinking of going to the next
large town to do a few errands for Christmas.</p>

<p class='c011'>A bright, sunny morning seemed to wish
the ladies good fortune. Old Hetty Downs,
their faithful maid-servant and protector,
looked after them in affectionate foreboding.
“Dear sakes, what devil’s wiles may
be played on them blessed innocents afore
they’re safe home again?” she murmured,
as they vanished round the corner of the
street that led to the railway station.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Dobin and Miss Lucinda paced discreetly
side by side down the main street of
Westbury. It was nothing like Boston, of
course, but the noise was slightly confusing,
and the passers-by sometimes roughly pushed
against them. Westbury was a consequential
manufacturing town, but a great convenience
at times like this. The trifling
Christmas gifts for their old neighbors and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Sunday-school scholars were purchased and
stowed away in their neat Fayal basket before
the serious commission of the day was
attended to. Here and there, in the shops,
disreputable frizzes were displayed in unblushing
effrontery, but no such vulgar
shopkeeper merited the patronage of the
Misses Dobin. They pretended not to observe
the unattractive goods, and went their
way to a low, one-storied building on a side
street, where an old tradesman lived. He
had been useful to the minister while he still
remained upon the earth and had need of a
wig, sandy in hue and increasingly sprinkled
with gray, as if it kept pace with other
changes of existence. But old Paley’s shutters
were up, and a bar of rough wood was
nailed firmly across the one that had lost its
fastening and would rack its feeble hinges
in the wind. Old Paley had always been
polite and bland; they really had looked forward
to a little chat with him; they had
heard a year or two before of his wife’s
death, and meant to offer sympathy. His
business of hair-dressing had been carried
on with that of parasol and umbrella mending,
and the condemned umbrella which was
his sign flapped and swung in the rising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>wind, a tattered skeleton before the closed
door. The ladies sighed and turned away;
they were beginning to feel tired; the day
was long, and they had not met with any
pleasures yet. “We might walk up the
street a little farther,” suggested Miss Lucinda;
“that is, if you are not tired,” as they
stood hesitating on the corner after they had
finished a short discussion of Mr. Paley’s
disappearance. Happily it was only a few
minutes before they came to a stop together
in front of a new, shining shop, where smirking
waxen heads all in a row were decked
with the latest fashions of wigs and frizzes.
One smiling fragment of a gentleman stared
so straight at Miss Lucinda with his black
eyes that she felt quite coy and embarrassed,
and was obliged to feign not to be conscious
of his admiration. But Miss Dobin, after
a brief delay, boldly opened the door and
entered; it was better to be sheltered in the
shop than exposed to public remark as they
gazed in at the windows. Miss Lucinda felt
her heart beat and her courage give out; she,
coward like, left the transaction of their
business to her sister, and turned to contemplate
the back of the handsome model. It
was a slight shock to find that he was not so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>attractive from this point of view. The wig
he wore was well made all round, but his
shoulders were roughly finished in a substance
that looked like plain plaster of Paris.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What can I have ze pleasure of showing
you, young ladees?” asked a person who
advanced; and Miss Lucinda faced about
to discover a smiling, middle-aged Frenchman,
who rubbed his hands together and
looked at his customers, first one and then
the other, with delightful deference. He
seemed a very civil nice person, the young
ladies thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My sister and I were thinking of buying
some little arrangements to wear above
the forehead.” Miss Dobin explained, with
pathetic dignity; but the Frenchman spared
her any further words. He looked with
eager interest at the bonnets, as if no lack
had attracted his notice before. “Ah, yes.
<i><span lang="fr">Je comprends</span></i>; ze high foreheads are not now
ze mode. Je prefer them, moi, yes, yes, but
ze ladees must accept ze fashion; zay must
now cover ze forehead with ze frizzes, ze
bangs, you say. As you wis’, as you wis’!”
and the tactful little man, with many shrugs
and merry gestures at such girlish fancies,
pulled down one box after another.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>It was a great relief to find that this was
no worse, to say the least, than any other
shopping, though the solemnity and secrecy
of the occasion were infringed upon by the
great supply of “arrangements” and the
loud discussion of the color of some crimps
a noisy girl was buying from a young saleswoman
the other side of the shop.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Dobin waved aside the wares which
were being displayed for her approval.
“Something—more simple, if you please,”—she
did not like to say “older.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But these are <i><span lang="fr">très simple</span></i>,” protested the
Frenchman. “We have nothing younger;”
and Miss Dobin and Miss Lucinda blushed,
and said no more. The Frenchman had his
own way; he persuaded them that nothing
was so suitable as some conspicuous forelocks
that matched their hair as it used to
be. They would have given anything rather
than leave their breakfast caps at home, if
they had known that their proper winter
bonnets must come off. They hardly listened
to the wig merchant’s glib voice as
Miss Dobin stood revealed before the merciless
mirror at the back of the shop.</p>

<p class='c011'>He made everything as easy as possible,
the friendly creature, and the ladies were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>grateful to him. Besides, now that the
bonnet was on again there was a great improvement
in Miss Dobin’s appearance.
She turned to Miss Lucinda, and saw a
gleam of delight in her eager countenance.
“It really is very becoming. I like the way
it parts over your forehead,” said the younger
sister, “but if it were long enough to go behind
the ears”—“<i><span lang="fr">Non, non</span></i>,” entreated
the Frenchman. “To make her the old
woman at once would be cruelty!” And
Lucinda, who was wondering how well she
would look in her turn, succumbed promptly
to such protestations. Yes, there was no
use in being old before their time. Dulham
was not quite keeping pace with the rest of
the world in these days, but they need not
drag behind everybody else, just because
they lived there.</p>

<p class='c011'>The price of the little arrangements was
much less than the sisters expected, and the
uncomfortable expense of their reverend father’s
wigs had been, it was proved, a thing
of the past. Miss Dobin treated her polite
Frenchman with great courtesy; indeed,
Miss Lucinda had more than once whispered
to her to talk French, and as they were
bowed out of the shop the gracious <em>Bongsure</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>of the elder lady seemed to act like the
string of a showerbath, and bring down an
awesome torrent of foreign phrases upon the
two guileless heads. It was impossible to
reply; the ladies bowed again, however, and
Miss Lucinda caught a last smile from the
handsome wax countenance in the window.
He appeared to regard her with fresh approval,
and she departed down the street
with mincing steps.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I feel as if anybody might look at me
now, sister,” said gentle Miss Lucinda.
“I confess, I have really suffered sometimes,
since I knew I looked so distressed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yours is lighter than I thought it was
in the shop,” remarked Miss Dobin doubtfully,
but she quickly added that perhaps
it would change a little. She was so perfectly
satisfied with her own appearance
that she could not bear to dim the pleasure
of any one else. The truth remained that
she never would have let Lucinda choose
that particular arrangement if she had seen
it first in a good light. And Lucinda was
thinking exactly the same of her companion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am sure we shall have no more neuralgia,”
said Miss Dobin. “I am sorry we
waited so long, dear,” and they tripped down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>the main street of Westbury, confident that
nobody would suspect them of being over
thirty. Indeed, they felt quite girlish, and
unconsciously looked sideways as they went
along, to see their satisfying reflections in the
windows. The great panes made excellent
mirrors, with not too clear or lasting pictures
of these comforted passers-by.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Frenchman in the shop was making
merry with his assistants. The two great
frisettes had long been out of fashion; he
had been lying in wait with them for two
unsuspecting country ladies, who could be
cajoled into such a purchase.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sister,” Miss Lucinda was saying, “you
know there is still an hour to wait before
our train goes. Suppose we take a little
longer walk down the other side of the way;”
and they strolled slowly back again. In
fact, they nearly missed the train, naughty
girls! Hetty would have been so worried,
they assured each other, but they reached
the station just in time.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lutie,” said Miss Dobin, “put up your
hand and part it from your forehead; it
seems to be getting a little out of place;”
and Miss Lucinda, who had just got breath
enough to speak, returned the information
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>that Miss Dobin’s was almost covering her
eyebrows. They might have to trim them
a little shorter; of course it could be done.
The darkness was falling; they had taken an
early dinner before they started, and now
they were tired and hungry after the exertion
of the afternoon, but the spirit of youth
flamed afresh in their hearts, and they were
very happy. If one’s heart remains young,
it is a sore trial to have the outward appearance
entirely at variance. It was the ladies’
nature to be girlish, and they found it impossible
not to be grateful to the flimsy,
ineffectual disguise which seemed to set them
right with the world. The old conductor,
who had known them for many years, looked
hard at them as he took their tickets, and,
being a man of humor and compassion, affected
not to notice anything remarkable in
their appearance. “You ladies never mean
to grow old, like the rest of us,” he said gallantly,
and the sisters fairly quaked with
joy. Their young hearts would forever keep
them truly unconscious of the cruel thievery
of time.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bless us!” the obnoxious Mrs. Woolden
was saying, at the other end of the car.
“There’s the old maid Dobbinses, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>they’ve bought ’em some bangs. I expect
they wanted to get thatched in a little before
real cold weather; but don’t they look just
like a pair o’ poodle dogs.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The little ladies descended wearily from
the train. Somehow they did not enjoy a
day’s shopping as much as they used. They
were certainly much obliged to Hetty for
sending her niece’s boy to meet them, with a
lantern; also for having a good warm supper
ready when they came in. Hetty took a
quick look at her mistresses, and returned to
the kitchen. “I knew somebody would be
foolin’ of ’em,” she assured herself angrily,
but she had to laugh. Their dear, kind
faces were wrinkled and pale, and the great
frizzes had lost their pretty curliness, and
were hanging down, almost straight and very
ugly, into the ladies’ eyes. They could not
tuck them up under their caps, as they were
sure might be done.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then came a succession of rainy days,
and nobody visited the rejuvenated household.
The frisettes looked very bright chestnut
by the light of day, and it must be confessed
that Miss Dobin took the scissors
and shortened Miss Lucinda’s half an inch,
and Miss Lucinda returned the compliment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>quite secretly, because each thought her
sister’s forehead lower than her own. Their
dear gray eyebrows were honestly displayed,
as if it were the fashion not to have them
match with wigs. Hetty at last spoke out,
and begged her mistresses, as they sat at
breakfast, to let her take the frizzes back and
change them. Her sister’s daughter worked
in that very shop, and though in the workroom,
would be able to oblige them, Hetty
was sure.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the ladies looked at each other in
pleased assurance, and then turned together
to look at Hetty, who stood already a little
apprehensive near the table, where she had
just put down a plateful of smoking drop-cakes.
The good creature really began to
look old.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are worn very much in town,” said
Miss Dobin. “We think it was quite fortunate
that the fashion came in just as our hair
was growing a trifle thin. I dare say we may
choose those that are a shade duller in color
when these are a little past. Oh, we shall not
want tea this evening, you remember, Hetty.
I am glad there is likely to be such a good
night for the sewing circle.” And Miss Dobin
and Miss Lucinda nodded and smiled.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>“Oh, my sakes alive!” the troubled handmaiden
groaned. “Going to the circle, be
they, to be snickered at! Well, the Dobbin
girls they was born, and the Dobbin girls
they will remain till they die; but if they
ain’t innocent Christian babes to those that
knows ’em well, mark me down for an idjit
myself! They believe them front-pieces has
set the clock back forty year or more, but if
they’re pleased to think so, let ’em!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Away paced the Dulham ladies, late in
the afternoon, to grace the parish occasion,
and face the amused scrutiny of their neighbors.
“I think we owe it to society to observe
the fashions of the day,” said Miss
Lucinda. “A lady cannot afford to be unattractive.
I feel now as if we were prepared
for anything!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>GOING TO SHREWSBURY.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The train stopped at a way station with
apparent unwillingness, and there was barely
time for one elderly passenger to be hurried
on board before a sudden jerk threw her almost
off her unsteady old feet and we moved
on. At my first glance I saw only a perturbed
old countrywoman, laden with a large
basket and a heavy bundle tied up in an
old-fashioned bundle-handkerchief; then I
discovered that she was a friend of mine,
Mrs. Peet, who lived on a small farm, several
miles from the village. She used to be
renowned for good butter and fresh eggs
and the earliest cowslip greens; in fact, she
always made the most of her farm’s slender
resources; but it was some time since I had
seen her drive by from market in her ancient
thorough-braced wagon.</p>

<p class='c011'>The brakeman followed her into the
crowded car, also carrying a number of packages.
I leaned forward and asked Mrs. Peet
to sit by me; it was a great pleasure to see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>her again. The brakeman seemed relieved,
and smiled as he tried to put part of his burden
into the rack overhead; but even the
flowered carpet-bag was much too large, and
he explained that he would take care of
everything at the end of the car. Mrs. Peet
was not large herself, but with the big basket,
and the bundle-handkerchief, and some
possessions of my own we had very little
spare room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So this ‘ere is what you call ridin’ in the
cars! Well, I do declare!” said my friend,
as soon as she had recovered herself a little.
She looked pale and as if she had been in
tears, but there was the familiar gleam of
good humor in her tired old eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where in the world are you going, Mrs.
Peet?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can’t be you ain’t heared about me,
dear?” said she. “Well, the world’s bigger
than I used to think ’t was. I’ve broke
up,—’twas the only thing <em>to</em> do,—and I’m
a-movin’ to Shrewsbury.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Shrewsbury? Have you sold the
farm?” I exclaimed, with sorrow and surprise.
Mrs. Peet was too old and too characteristic
to be suddenly transplanted from
her native soil.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“’Twa’n’t mine, the place wa’n’t.” Her
pleasant face hardened slightly. “He was
coaxed an’ over-persuaded into signin’ off
before he was taken away. Is’iah, son of
his sister that married old Josh Peet, come
it over him about his bein’ past work and
how he’d do for him like an own son, an’
we owed him a little somethin’. I’d paid
off everythin’ but that, an’ was fool enough
to leave it till the last, on account o’ Is’iah’s
bein’ a relation and not needin’ his pay much
as some others did. It’s hurt me to have
the place fall into other hands. Some
wanted me to go right to law; but ’twouldn’t
be no use. Is’iah’s smarter ’n I be about
them matters. You see he’s got my name
on the paper, too; he said ’twas somethin’
’bout bein’ responsible for the taxes. We
was scant o’ money, an’ I was wore out with
watchin’ an’ being broke o’ my rest. After
my tryin’ hard for risin’ forty-five year to
provide for bein’ past work, here I be, dear,
here I be! I used to drive things smart, you
remember. But we was fools enough in ’72
to put about everythin’ we had safe in the
bank into that spool factory that come to
nothin’. But I tell ye I could ha’ kept myself
long’s I lived, if I could ha’ held the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>place. I’d parted with most o’ the woodland,
if Is’iah’d coveted it. He was welcome
to that, ’cept what might keep me in oven-wood.
I’ve always desired to travel an’ see
somethin’ o’ the world, but I’ve got the
chance now when I don’t value it no great.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shrewsbury is a busy, pleasant place,”
I ventured to say by way of comfort, though
my heart was filled with rage at the trickery
of Isaiah Peet, who had always looked like
a fox and behaved like one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shrewsbury’s be’n held up consid’able
for me to smile at,” said the poor old soul,
“but I tell ye, dear, it’s hard to go an’ live
twenty-two miles from where you’ve always
had your home and friends. It may divert
me, but it won’t be home. You might as
well set out one o’ my old apple-trees on the
beach, so ’t could see the waves come in,—there
wouldn’t be no please to it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are you going to live in Shrewsbury?”
I asked presently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t expect to stop long, dear creatur’.
I’m ’most seventy-six year old,” and Mrs.
Peet turned to look at me with pathetic
amusement in her honest wrinkled face. “I
said right out to Is’iah, before a roomful o’
the neighbors, that I expected it of him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>git me home an’ bury me when my time
come, and do it respectable; but I wanted
to airn my livin’, if ’twas so I could, till
then. He’d made sly talk, you see, about
my electin’ to leave the farm and go ’long
some o’ my own folks; but”—and she
whispered this carefully—“he didn’t give
me no chance to stay there without hurtin’
my pride and dependin’ on him. I ain’t said
that to many folks, but all must have suspected.
A good sight on ’em’s had money
of Is’iah, though, and they don’t like to do
nothin’ but take his part an’ be pretty soft
spoken, fear it’ll git to his ears. Well,
well, dear, we’ll let it be bygones, and not
think of it no more;” but I saw the great
tears roll slowly down her cheeks, and she
pulled her bonnet forward impatiently, and
looked the other way.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There looks to be plenty o’ good farmin’
land in this part o’ the country,” she said, a
minute later. “Where be we now? See
them handsome farm buildin’s; he must be
a well-off man.” But I had to tell my companion
that we were still within the borders
of the old town where we had both been
born. Mrs. Peet gave a pleased little laugh,
like a girl. “I’m expectin’ Shrewsbury to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>pop up any minute. I’m feared to be kerried
right by. I wa’n’t never aboard of the
cars before, but I’ve so often thought about
em’ I don’t know but it seems natural.
Ain’t it jest like flyin’ through the air? I
can’t catch holt to see nothin’. Land! and
here’s my old cat goin’ too, and never mistrustin’.
I ain’t told you that I’d fetched
her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is she in that basket?” I inquired with
interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yis, dear. Truth was, I calc’lated to
have her put out o’ the misery o’ movin’, an
spoke to one o’ the Barnes boys, an’ he
promised me all fair; but he wa’n’t there
in season, an’ I kind o’ made excuse to myself
to fetch her along. She’s an’ old creatur’,
like me, an’ I can make shift to keep
her some way or ’nuther; there’s probably
mice where we’re goin’, an’ she’s a proper
mouser that can about keep herself if there’s
any sort o’ chance. ’Twill be somethin’ o’
home to see her goin’ an’ comin’, but I expect
we’re both on us goin’ to miss our old
haunts. I’d love to know what kind o’
mousin’ there’s goin’ to be for me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mustn’t worry,” I answered, with
all the bravery and assurance that I could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>muster. “Your niece will be thankful to
have you with her. Is she one of Mrs.
Winn’s daughters?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, they ain’t able; it’s Sister
Wayland’s darter Isabella, that married the
overseer of the gre’t carriage-shop. I ain’t
seen her since just after she was married;
but I turned to her first because I knew she
was best able to have me, and then I can see
just how the other girls is situated and make
me some kind of a plot. I wrote to Isabella,
though she <em>is</em> ambitious, and said ’twas so
I’d got to ask to come an’ make her a visit,
an’ she wrote back she would be glad to have
me; but she didn’t write right off, and her
letter was scented up dreadful strong with
some sort o’ essence, and I don’t feel heartened
about no great of a welcome. But
there, I’ve got eyes, an’ I can see <em>how</em> ’tis
when I git <em>where</em> ’tis. Sister Winn’s gals
ain’t married, an’ they’ve always boarded,
an’ worked in the shop on trimmin’s. Isabella’s
well off; she had some means from
her father’s sister. I thought it all over by
night an’ day, an’ I recalled that our folks
kept Sister Wayland’s folks all one winter,
when he’d failed up and got into trouble.
I’m reckonin’ on sendin’ over to-night an’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>gittin’ the Winn gals to come and see me
and advise. Perhaps some on ’em may
know of somebody that’ll take me for what
help I can give about house, or some clever
folks that have been lookin’ for a smart cat,
any ways; no, I don’t know’s I could let
her go to strangers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was two or three o’ the folks
round home that acted real warm-hearted
towards me, an’ urged me to come an’ winter
with ’em,” continued the exile; “an’ this
mornin’ I wished I’d agreed to, ’twas so
hard to break away. But now it’s done I
feel more ’n ever it’s best. I couldn’t bear
to live right in sight o’ the old place, and
come spring I shouldn’t ‘prove of nothing
Is’iah ondertakes to do with the land. Oh,
dear sakes! now it comes hard with me not
to have had no child’n. When I was young
an’ workin’ hard and into everything, I felt
kind of free an’ superior to them that was
so blessed, an’ their houses cluttered up from
mornin’ till night, but I tell ye it comes
home to me now. I’d be most willin’ to
own to even Is’iah, mean ’s he is; but I tell
ye I’d took it out of him ‘fore he was a
grown man, if there’d be’n any virtue in
cow-hidin’ of him. Folks don’t look like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>wild creatur’s for nothin’. Is’iah’s got fox
blood in him, an’ p’r’haps ’tis his misfortune.
His own mother always favored the
looks of an old fox, true ’s the world; she
was a poor tool,—a poor tool! I d’know ’s
we ought to blame him same ’s we do.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve always been a master proud woman,
if I was riz among the pastures,” Mrs.
Peet added, half to herself. There was no
use in saying much to her; she was conscious
of little beside her own thoughts and
the smouldering excitement caused by this
great crisis in her simple existence. Yet the
atmosphere of her loneliness, uncertainty,
and sorrow was so touching that after scolding
again at her nephew’s treachery, and
finding the tears come fast to my eyes as she
talked, I looked intently out of the car window,
and tried to think what could be done
for the poor soul. She was one of the old-time
people, and I hated to have her go away;
but even if she could keep her home she
would soon be too feeble to live there alone,
and some definite plan must be made for her
comfort. Farms in that neighborhood were
not valuable. Perhaps through the agency
of the law and quite in secret, Isaiah Peet
could be forced to give up his unrighteous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>claim. Perhaps, too, the Winn girls, who
were really no longer young, might have
saved something, and would come home
again. But it was easy to make such pictures
in one’s mind, and I must do what I
could through other people, for I was just
leaving home for a long time. I wondered
sadly about Mrs. Peet’s future, and the ambitious
Isabella, and the favorite Sister
Winn’s daughters, to whom, with all their
kindliness of heart, the care of so old and
perhaps so dependent an aunt might seem
impossible. The truth about life in Shrewsbury
would soon be known; more than half
the short journey was already past.</p>

<p class='c011'>To my great pleasure, my fellow-traveler
now began to forget her own troubles in looking
about her. She was an alert, quickly
interested old soul, and this was a bit of neutral
ground between the farm and Shrewsbury,
where she was unattached and irresponsible.
She had lived through the last
tragic moments of her old life, and felt a
certain relief, and Shrewsbury might be as
far away as the other side of the Rocky
Mountains for all the consciousness she had
of its real existence. She was simply a traveler
for the time being, and began to comment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>with delicious phrases and shrewd
understanding of human nature, on two or
three persons near us who attracted her
attention.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where do you s’pose they be all goin’?”
she asked contemptuously. “There ain’t
none on ’em but what looks kind o’ respectable.
I’ll warrant they’ve left work to
home they’d ought to be doin’. I knowed,
if ever I stopped to think, that cars was
hived full o’ folks, an’ wa’n’t run to an’ fro
for nothin’; but these can’t be quite up to
the average, be they? Some on ’em’s real
thrif’less? guess they’ve be’n shoved out o’
the last place, an’ goin’ to try the next one,—<em>like
me</em>, I suppose you’ll want to say!
Jest see that flauntin’ old creatur’ that looks
like a stopped clock. There! everybody
can’t be o’ one goodness, even preachers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I was glad to have Mrs. Peet amused, and
we were as cheerful as we could be for a few
minutes. She said earnestly that she hoped
to be forgiven for such talk, but there were
some kinds of folks in the cars that she
never had seen before. But when the conductor
came to take her ticket she relapsed
into her first state of mind, and was at a
loss.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“You’ll have to look after me, dear, when
we get to Shrewsbury,” she said, after we
had spent some distracted moments in hunting
for the ticket, and the cat had almost
escaped from the basket, and the bundle-handkerchief
had become untied and all its
miscellaneous contents scattered about our
laps and the floor. It was a touching collection
of the last odds and ends of Mrs. Peet’s
housekeeping: some battered books, and
singed holders for flatirons, and the faded
little shoulder shawl that I had seen her
wear many a day about her bent shoulders.
There were her old tin match-box spilling
all its matches, and a goose-wing for brushing
up ashes, and her much-thumbed Leavitt’s
Almanac. It was most pathetic to see
these poor trifles out of their places. At
last the ticket was found in her left-hand
woolen glove, where her stiff, work-worn
hand had grown used to the feeling of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shouldn’t wonder, now, if I come to
like living over to Shrewsbury first-rate,”
she insisted, turning to me with a hopeful,
eager look to see if I differed. “You see
’twon’t be so tough for me as if I hadn’t
always felt it lurking within me to go off
some day or ’nother an’ see how other folks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>did things. I do’ know but what the Winn
gals have laid up somethin’ sufficient for us
to take a house, with the little mite I’ve got
by me. I might keep house for us all, ’stead
o’ boardin’ round in other folks’ houses.
That I ain’t never been demeaned to, but I
dare say I should find it pleasant in some
ways. Town folks has got the upper hand
o’ country folks, but with all their work an’
pride they can’t make a dandelion. I do’
know the times when I’ve set out to wash
Monday mornin’s, an’ tied out the line betwixt
the old pucker-pear tree and the corner
o’ the barn, an’ thought, ‘Here I be with the
same kind o’ week’s work right over again.’
I’d wonder kind o’ f’erce if I couldn’t git
out of it noways; an’ now here I be out of it,
and an uprooteder creatur’ never stood on
the airth. Just as I got to feel I had somethin’
ahead come that spool-factory business.
There! you know he never was a forehanded
man; his health was slim, and he got discouraged
pretty nigh before ever he begun.
I hope he don’t know I’m turned out o’ the
old place. ‘Is’iah’s well off; he’ll do the
right thing by ye,’ says he. But my! I
turned hot all over when I found out what
I’d put my name to,—me that had always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>be’n counted a smart woman! I did undertake
to read it over, but I couldn’t sense it.
I’ve told all the folks so when they laid it
off on to me some: but hand-writin’ is awful
tedious readin’ and my head felt that day as
if the works was gone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I ain’t goin’ to sag on to nobody,” she
assured me eagerly, as the train rushed
along. “I’ve got more work in me now
than folks expects at my age. I may be consid’able
use to Isabella. She’s got a family,
an’ I’ll take right holt in the kitchen or
with the little gals. She had four on ’em,
last I heared. Isabella was never one that
liked housework. Little gals! I do’ know
now but what they must be about grown,
time doos slip away so. I expect I shall
look outlandish to ’em. But there! everybody
knows me to home, an’ nobody knows
me to Shrewsbury; ’twon’t make a mite o’
difference, if I take holt willin’.”</p>

<p class='c011'>I hoped, as I looked at Mrs. Peet, that
she would never be persuaded to cast off the
gathered brown silk bonnet and the plain
shawl that she had worn so many years;
but Isabella might think it best to insist
upon more modern fashions. Mrs. Peet suggested,
as if it were a matter of little consequence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>that she had kept it in mind to buy
some mourning; but there were other things
to be thought of first, and so she had let it
go until winter, any way, or until she should
be fairly settled in Shrewsbury.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are your nieces expecting you by this
train?” I was moved to ask, though with
all the good soul’s ready talk and appealing
manner I could hardly believe that she was
going to Shrewsbury for more than a visit;
it seemed as if she must return to the worn
old farmhouse over by the sheep-lands.
She answered that one of the Barnes boys
had written a letter for her the day before,
and there was evidently little uneasiness
about her first reception.</p>

<p class='c011'>We drew near the junction where I must
leave her within a mile of the town. The
cat was clawing indignantly at the basket,
and her mistress grew as impatient of the
car. She began to look very old and pale,
my poor fellow-traveler, and said that she
felt dizzy, going so fast. Presently the
friendly red-cheeked young brakeman came
along, bringing the carpet-bag and other
possessions, and insisted upon taking the
alarmed cat beside, in spite of an aggressive
paw that had worked its way through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>wicker prison. Mrs. Peet watched her
goods disappear with suspicions eyes, and
clutched her bundle-handkerchief as if it
might be all that she could save. Then she
anxiously got to her feet, much too soon,
and when I said good-by to her at the car
door she was ready to cry. I pointed to the
car which she was to take next on the
branch line of railway, and I assured her
that it was only a few minutes’ ride to
Shrewsbury, and that I felt certain she
would find somebody waiting. The sight of
that worn, thin figure adventuring alone
across the platform gave my heart a sharp
pang as the train carried me away.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some of the passengers who sat near
asked me about my old friend with great
sympathy, after she had gone. There was a
look of tragedy about her, and indeed it
had been impossible not to get a good deal
of her history, as she talked straight on in
the same tone, when we stopped at a station,
as if the train were going at full speed,
and some of her remarks caused pity and
amusements by turns. At the last minute
she said, with deep self-reproach, “Why, I
haven’t asked a word about your folks;
but you’d ought to excuse such an old stray
hen as I be.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>In the spring I was driving by on what
the old people of my native town call the
sheep-lands road, and the sight of Mrs.
Peet’s former home brought our former
journey freshly to my mind. I had last
heard from her just after she got to Shrewsbury,
when she had sent me a message.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you ever heard how she got on?”
I eagerly asked my companion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Didn’t I tell you that I met her in
Shrewsbury High Street one day?” I was
answered. “She seemed perfectly delighted
with everything. Her nieces have
laid up a good bit of money, and are soon
to leave the mill, and most thankful to have
old Mrs. Peet with them. Somebody told
me that they wished to buy the farm here,
and come back to live, but she wouldn’t
hear of it, and thought they would miss too
many privileges. She has been going to
concerts and lectures this winter, and insists
that Isaiah did her a good turn.”</p>

<p class='c011'>We both laughed. My own heart was filled
with joy, for the uncertain, lonely face of
this homeless old woman had often haunted
me. The rain-blackened little house did
certainly look dreary, and a whole lifetime
of patient toil had left few traces. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>pucker-pear tree was in full bloom, However,
and gave a welcome gayety to the deserted
dooryard.</p>

<p class='c011'>A little way beyond we met Isaiah Peet,
the prosperous money-lender, who had
cheated the old woman of her own. I fancied
that he looked somewhat ashamed, as
he recognized us. To my surprise, he
stopped his horse in most social fashion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Old Aunt Peet’s passed away,” he informed
me briskly. “She had a shock,
and went right off sudden yisterday forenoon.
I’m about now tendin’ to the funeral
‘rangements. She’s be’n extry smart,
they say, all winter,—out to meetin’ last
Sabbath; never enjoyed herself so complete
as she has this past month. She’d be’n a
very hard-workin’ woman. Her folks was
glad to have her there, and give her every
attention. The place here never was good
for nothin’. The old gen’leman,—uncle,
you know,—he wore hisself out tryin’ to
make a livin’ off from it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was an ostentatious sympathy and
half-suppressed excitement from bad news
which were quite lost upon us, and we did
not linger to hear much more. It seemed
to me as if I had known Mrs. Peet better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>than any one else had known her. I had
counted upon seeing her again, and hearing
her own account of Shrewsbury life, its
pleasures and its limitations. I wondered
what had become of the cat and the contents
of the faded bundle-handkerchief.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE ONLY ROSE.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>I.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Just where the village abruptly ended,
and the green mowing fields began, stood
Mrs. Bickford’s house, looking down the
road with all its windows, and topped by
two prim chimneys that stood up like ears.
It was placed with an end to the road,
and fronted southward; you could follow a
straight path from the gate past the front
door and find Mrs. Bickford sitting by the
last window of all in the kitchen, unless she
were solemnly stepping about, prolonging the
stern duties of her solitary housekeeping.</p>

<p class='c011'>One day in early summer, when almost
every one else in Fairfield had put her house
plants out of doors, there were still three
flower pots on a kitchen window-sill. Mrs.
Bickford spent but little time over her rose
and geranium and Jerusalem cherry-tree,
although they had gained a kind of personality
born of long association. They rarely
undertook to bloom, but had most courageously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>maintained life in spite of their owner’s
unsympathetic but conscientious care.
Later in the season she would carry them
out of doors, and leave them, until the time
of frosts, under the shade of a great apple-tree,
where they might make the best of
what the summer had to give.</p>

<p class='c011'>The afternoon sun was pouring in, the
Jerusalem cherry-tree drooped its leaves in
the heat and looked pale, when a neighbor,
Miss Pendexter, came in from the next
house but one to make a friendly call. As
she passed the parlor with its shut blinds,
and the sitting-room, also shaded carefully
from the light, she wished, as she had done
many times before, that somebody beside the
owner might have the pleasure of living in
and using so good and pleasant a house.
Mrs. Bickford always complained of having
so much care, even while she valued herself
intelligently upon having the right to do as
she pleased with one of the best houses in
Fairfield. Miss Pendexter was a cheerful,
even gay little person, who always brought
a pleasant flurry of excitement, and usually
had a genuine though small piece of news to
tell, or some new aspect of already received
information.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Mrs. Bickford smiled as she looked up to
see this sprightly neighbor coming. She
had no gift at entertaining herself, and was
always glad, as one might say, to be taken
off her own hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Pendexter smiled back, as if she felt
herself to be equal to the occasion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How be you to-day?” the guest asked
kindly, as she entered the kitchen. “Why,
what a sight o’ flowers, Mis’ Bickford!
What be you goin’ to do with ’em all?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Bickford wore a grave expression as
she glanced over her spectacles. “My sister’s
boy fetched ’em over,” she answered.
“You know my sister Parsons’s a great hand
to raise flowers, an’ this boy takes after her.
He said his mother thought the gardin never
looked handsomer, and she picked me these
to send over. They was sendin’ a team to
Westbury for some fertilizer to put on the
land, an’ he come with the men, an’ stopped
to eat his dinner ’long o’ me. He’s been
growin’ fast, and looks peakëd. I expect
sister ’Liza thought the ride, this pleasant
day, would do him good. ’Liza sent word
for me to come over and pass some days next
week, but it ain’t so that I can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, it ’s a pretty time of year to go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>off and make a little visit,” suggested the
neighbor encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I ain’t got my sitting-room chamber
carpet taken up yet,” sighed Mrs. Bickford.
“I do feel condemned. I might have done
it to-day, but ’twas all at end when I saw
Tommy coming. There, he’s a likely boy,
an’ so relished his dinner; I happened to be
well prepared. I don’t know but he’s my
favorite o’ that family. Only I’ve been
sittin’ here thinkin’, since he went, an’ I
can’t remember that I ever was so belated
with my spring cleaning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Twas owin’ to the weather,” explained
Miss Pendexter. “None of us could be so
smart as common this year, not even the lazy
ones that always get one room done the first
o’ March, and brag of it to others’ shame,
and then never let on when they do the rest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The two women laughed together cheerfully.
Mrs. Bickford had put up the wide
leaf of her large table between the windows
and spread out the flowers. She was sorting
them slowly into three heaps.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I do declare if you haven’t got
a rose in bloom yourself!” exclaimed Miss
Pendexter abruptly, as if the bud had not
been announced weeks before, and its progress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>regularly commented upon. “Ain’t it
a lovely rose? Why, Mis’ Bickford!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes’m, it’s out to-day,” said Mrs. Bickford,
with a somewhat plaintive air. “I’m
glad you come in so as to see it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The bright flower was like a face. Somehow,
the beauty and life of it were surprising
in the plain room, like a gay little child
who might suddenly appear in a doorway.
Miss Pendexter forgot herself and her hostess
and the tangled mass of garden flowers
in looking at the red rose. She even forgot
that it was incumbent upon her to carry forward
the conversation. Mrs. Bickford was
subject to fits of untimely silence which
made her friends anxiously sweep the corners
of their minds in search of something to
say, but any one who looked at her now could
easily see that it was not poverty of thought
that made her speechless, but an overburdening
sense of the inexpressible.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Goin’ to make up all your flowers into
bo’quets? I think the short-stemmed kinds
is often pretty in a dish,” suggested Miss
Pendexter compassionately.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought I should make them into three
bo’quets. I wish there wa’n’t quite so many.
Sister Eliza’s very lavish with her flowers;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>she’s always been a kind sister, too,” said
Mrs. Bickford vaguely. She was not apt to
speak with so much sentiment, and as her
neighbor looked at her narrowly she detected
unusual signs of emotion. It suddenly became
evident that the three nosegays were
connected in her mind with her bereavement
of three husbands, and Miss Pendexter’s
easily roused curiosity was quieted by
the discovery that her friend was bent upon
a visit to the burying-ground. It was the
time of year when she was pretty sure to
spend an afternoon there, and sometimes
they had taken the walk in company. Miss
Pendexter expected to receive the usual invitation,
but there was nothing further said
at the moment, and she looked again at the
pretty rose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Bickford aimlessly handled the syringas
and flowering almond sprays, choosing
them out of the fragrant heap only to lay
them down again. She glanced out of the
window; then gave Miss Pendexter a long
expressive look.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I expect you’re going to carry ’em over
to the burying-ground?” inquired the guest,
in a sympathetic tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes’m,” said the hostess, now well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>started in conversation and in quite her
every-day manner. “You see I was goin’
over to my brother’s folks to-morrow in
South Fairfield, to pass the day; they said
they were goin’ to send over to-morrow
to leave a wagon at the blacksmith’s, and
they’d hitch that to their best chaise, so
I could ride back very comfortable. You
know I have to avoid bein’ out in the mornin’
sun?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Pendexter smiled to herself at this
moment; she was obliged to move from her
chair at the window, the May sun was so
hot on her back, for Mrs. Bickford always
kept the curtains rolled high up, out of the
way, for fear of fading and dust. The
kitchen was a blaze of light. As for the
Sunday chaise being sent, it was well known
that Mrs. Bickford’s married brothers and
sisters comprehended the truth that she was
a woman of property, and had neither chick
nor child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So I thought ’twas a good opportunity
to just stop an’ see if the lot was in good
order,—last spring Mr. Wallis’s stone hove
with the frost; an’ so I could take these
flowers.” She gave a sigh. “I ain’t one
that can bear flowers in a close room,—they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>bring on a headache; but I enjoy ’em as
much as anybody to look at, only you never
know what to put ’em in. If I could be out
in the mornin’ sun, as some do, and keep
flowers in the house, I should have me a
gardin, certain,” and she sighed again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A garden’s a sight o’ care, but I don’t
begrudge none o’ the care I give to mine. I
have to scant on flowers so ’s to make room
for pole beans,” said Miss Pendexter gayly.
She had only a tiny strip of land behind her
house, but she always had something to give
away, and made riches out of her narrow
poverty. “A few flowers gives me just as
much pleasure as more would,” she added.
“You get acquainted with things when
you’ve only got one or two roots. My
sweet-williams is just like folks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Bickford was partial to sweet-williams,”
said Mrs. Bickford. “I never knew
him to take notice of no other sort of flowers.
When we’d be over to Eliza’s, he’d
walk down her gardin, an’ he’d never make
no comments until he come to them, and
then he’d say, ‘Those is sweet-williams.’
How many times I’ve heard him!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You ought to have a sprig of ’em for his
bo’quet,” suggested Miss Pendexter.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“Yes, I’ve put a sprig in,” said her companion.</p>

<p class='c011'>At this moment Miss Pendexter took a
good look at the bouquets, and found that
they were as nearly alike as careful hands
could make them. Mrs. Bickford was evidently
trying to reach absolute impartiality.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know but you think it’s foolish
to tie ’em up this afternoon,” she said presently,
as she wound the first with a stout
string. “I thought I could put ’em in a
bucket o’ water out in the shed, where there’s
a draught o’ air, and then I should have all
my time in the morning. I shall have a
good deal to do before I go. I always sweep
the setting-room and front entry Wednesdays.
I want to leave everything nice, goin’
away for all day so. So I meant to get the
flowers out o’ the way this afternoon. Why,
it’s most half past four, ain’t it? But I
sha’n’t pick the rose till mornin’; ’twill be
blowed out better then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The rose?” questioned Miss Pendexter.
“Why, are you goin’ to pick that, too?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I be. I never like to let ’em fade
on the bush. There, that’s just what’s
a-troublin’ me,” and she turned to give a
long, imploring look at the friend who sat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>beside her. Miss Pendexter had moved her
chair before the table in order to be out
of the way of the sun. “I don’t seem to
know which of ’em ought to have it,” said
Mrs. Bickford despondently. “I do so hate
to make a choice between ’em; they all had
their good points, especially Mr. Bickford,
and I respected ’em all. I don’t know but
what I think of one on ’em ’most as much
as I do of the other.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, ’tis difficult for you, ain’t it?”
responded Miss Pendexter. “I don’t know ’s
I can offer advice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I s’pose not,” answered her friend
slowly, with a shadow of disappointment
coming over her calm face. “I feel sure you
would if you could, Abby.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Both of the women felt as if they were
powerless before a great emergency.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s one thing,—they’re all in a
better world now,” said Miss Pendexter, in
a self-conscious and constrained voice; “they
can’t feel such little things or take note o’
slights same ’s we can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No; I suppose ’tis myself that wants to
be just,” answered Mrs. Bickford. “I feel
under obligations to my last husband when I
look about and see how comfortable he left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>me. Poor Mr. Wallis had his great projects,
an’ perhaps if he’d lived longer he’d
have made a record; but when he died he’d
failed all up, owing to that patent cornsheller
he’d put everything into, and, as you
know, I had to get along ’most any way I
could for the next few years. Life was very
disappointing with Mr. Wallis, but he meant
well, an’ used to be an amiable person to
dwell with, until his temper got spoilt makin’
so many hopes an’ havin’ ’em turn out
failures. He had consider’ble of an air,
an’ dressed very handsome when I was first
acquainted with him, Mr. Wallis did. I
don’t know ’s you ever knew Mr. Wallis in
his prime?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He died the year I moved over here from
North Denfield,” said Miss Pendexter, in
a tone of sympathy. “I just knew him by
sight. I was to his funeral. You know you
lived in what we call the Wells house then,
and I felt it wouldn’t be an intrusion, we
was such near neighbors. The first time I
ever was in your house was just before that,
when he was sick, an’ Mary ’Becca Wade
an’ I called to see if there was anything we
could do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They used to say about town that Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Wallis went to an’ fro like a mail-coach an’
brought nothin’ to pass,” announced Mrs.
Bickford without bitterness. “He ought to
have had a better chance than he did in this
little neighborhood. You see, he had excellent
ideas, but he never’d learned the
machinist’s trade, and there was somethin’
the matter with every model he contrived.
I used to be real narrow-minded when he
talked about moving ’way up to Lowell, or
some o’ them places; I hated to think of
leaving my folks; and now I see that I
never done right by him. His ideas was
good. I know once he was on a jury, and
there was a man stopping to the tavern
where he was, near the court house, a man
that traveled for a firm to Lowell; and they
engaged in talk, an’ Mr. Wallis let out some
o’ his notions an’ contrivances, an’ he said
that man wouldn’t hardly stop to eat, he
was so interested, an’ said he’d look for a
chance for him up to Lowell. It all sounded
so well that I kind of begun to think about
goin’ myself. Mr. Wallis said we’d close
the house here, and go an’ board through the
winter. But he never heard a word from
him, and the disappointment was one he
never got over. I think of it now different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>from what I did then. I often used to be
kind of disapproving to Mr. Wallis; but
there, he used to be always tellin’ over his
great projects. Somebody told me once that
a man by the same name of the one he met
while he was to court had got some patents
for the very things Mr. Wallis used to be
workin’ over; but ’twas after he died, an’
I don’t know ’s ’twas in him to ever really
set things up so other folks could ha’ seen
their value. His machines always used to
work kind of rickety, but folks used to
come from all round to see ’em; they was
curiosities if they wa’n’t nothin’ else, an’
gave him a name.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Bickford paused a moment, with
some geranium leaves in her hand, and
seemed to suppress with difficulty a desire to
speak even more freely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was a dreadful notional man,” she
said at last, regretfully, and as if this fact
were a poor substitute for what had just
been in her mind. “I recollect one time
he worked all through the early winter over
my churn, an’ got it so it would go three
quarters of an hour all of itself if you
wound it up; an’ if you’ll believe it, he
went an’ spent all that time for nothin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>when the cow was dry, an’ we was with difficulty
borrowin’ a pint o’ milk a day somewheres
in the neighborhood just to get along
with.” Mrs. Bickford flushed with displeasure,
and turned to look at her visitor.
“Now what do you think of such a man as
that, Miss Pendexter?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I don’t know but ’twas just as
good for an invention,” answered Miss Pendexter
timidly; but her friend looked doubtful,
and did not appear to understand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I asked him where it was, one day
that spring when I’d got tired to death
churnin’, an’ the butter wouldn’t come in a
churn I’d had to borrow, and he’d gone an’
took ours all to pieces to get the works to
make some other useless contrivance with.
He had no sort of a business turn, but he
was well meanin’, Mr. Wallis was, an’ full
o’ divertin’ talk; they used to call him very
good company. I see now that he never had
no proper chance. I’ve always regretted
Mr. Wallis,” said she who was now the
widow Bickford.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m sure you always speak well of him,”
said Miss Pendexter. “’Twas a pity he
hadn’t got among good business men, who
could push his inventions an’ do all the
business part.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“I was left very poor an’ needy for them
next few years,” said Mrs. Bickford mournfully;
“but he never’d give up but what he
should die worth his fifty thousand dollars.
I don’t see now how I ever did get along
them next few years without him; but there,
I always managed to keep a pig, an’ sister
Eliza gave me my potatoes, and I made out
somehow. I could dig me a few greens, you
know, in spring, and then ’twould come
strawberry-time, and other berries a-follow-in’
on. I was always decent to go to meetin’
till within the last six months, an’ then
I went in bad weather, when folks wouldn’t
notice; but ’twas a rainy summer, an’ I
managed to get considerable preachin’ after
all. My clothes looked proper enough when
’twas a wet Sabbath. I often think o’
them pinched days now, when I’m left so
comfortable by Mr. Bickford.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes’m, you’ve everything to be thankful
for,” said Miss Pendexter, who was as
poor herself at that moment as her friend
had ever been, and who could never dream
of venturing upon the support and companionship
of a pig. “Mr. Bickford was a very
personable man,” she hastened to say, the
confidences were so intimate and interesting.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“Oh, very,” replied Mrs. Bickford;
“there was something about him that was
very marked. Strangers would always ask
who he was as he come into meetin’. His
words counted; he never spoke except he
had to. ’Twas a relief at first after Mr.
Wallis’s being so fluent; but Mr. Wallis
was splendid company for winter evenings,—’twould
be eight o’clock before you knew
it. I didn’t use to listen to it all, but he
had a great deal of information. Mr. Bickford
was dreadful dignified; I used to be
sort of meechin’ with him along at the first,
for fear he’d disapprove of me; but I found
out ’twa’n’t no need; he was always just
that way, an’ done everything by rule an’
measure. He hadn’t the mind of my other
husbands, but he was a very dignified appearing
man; he used ’most always to sleep
in the evenin’s, Mr. Bickford did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Them is lovely bo’quets, certain!” exclaimed
Miss Pendexter. “Why, I couldn’t
tell ’em apart; the flowers are comin’ out
just right, aren’t they?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Bickford nodded assent, and then,
startled by sudden recollection, she cast a
quick glance at the rose in the window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I always seem to forget about your first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>husband, Mr. Fraley,” Miss Pendexter suggested
bravely. “I’ve often heard you
speak of him, too, but he’d passed away
long before I ever knew you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was but a boy,” said Mrs. Bickford.
“I thought the world was done for
me when he died, but I’ve often thought
since ’twas a mercy for him. He come of a
very melancholy family, and all his brothers
an’ sisters enjoyed poor health; it
might have been his lot. Folks said we was
as pretty a couple as ever come into church;
we was both dark, with black eyes an’ a good
deal o’ color,—you wouldn’t expect it to
see me now. Albert was one that held up
his head, and looked as if he meant to own
the town, an’ he had a good word for everybody.
I don’t know what the years might
have brought.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a long pause. Mrs. Bickford
leaned over to pick up a heavy-headed Guelder-rose
that had dropped on the floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I expect ’twas what they call fallin’ in
love,” she added, in a different tone; “he
wa’n’t nothin’ but a boy, an’ I wa’n’t nothin’
but a girl, but we was dreadful happy.
He didn’t favor his folks,—they all had
hay-colored hair and was faded-looking, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>his mother; they was alike, and looked
alike, an’ set everything by each other. He
was just the kind of strong, hearty young
man that goes right off if they get a fever.
We was just settled on a little farm, an’
he’d have done well if he’d had time; as
it was, he left debts. He had a hasty temper,
that was his great fault, but Albert had
a lovely voice to sing; they said there wa’n’t
no such tenor voice in this part o’ the State.
I could hear him singin’ to himself right out
in the field a-ploughin’ or hoein’, an’ he
didn’t know it half o’ the time, no more ’n
a common bird would. I don’t know ’s I
valued his gift as I ought to, but there was
nothin’ ever sounded so sweet to me. I
ain’t one that ever had much fancy, but I
knowed Albert had a pretty voice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Bickford’s own voice trembled a
little, but she held up the last bouquet and
examined it critically. “I must hurry now
an’ put these in water,” she said, in a matter
of fact tone. Little Miss Pendexter was
so quiet and sympathetic that her hostess
felt no more embarrassed than if she had
been talking only to herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, they do seem to droop some; ’tis
a little warm for them here in the sun,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Miss Pendexter; “but you’ll find they’ll all
come up if you give them their fill o’ water.
They’ll look very handsome to-morrow;
folks’ll notice them from the road. You’ve
arranged them very tasty, Mis’ Bickford.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They do look pretty, don’t they?”
Mrs. Bickford regarded the three in turn.
“I want to have them all pretty. You may
deem it strange, Abby.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, no, Mis’ Bickford,” said the guest
sincerely, although a little perplexed by the
solemnity of the occasion. “I know how
’tis with friends,—that having one don’t
keep you from wantin’ another; ’tis just
like havin’ somethin’ to eat, and then wantin’
somethin’ to drink just the same. I expect
all friends find their places.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Mrs. Bickford was not interested
in this figure, and still looked vague and
anxious as she began to brush the broken
stems and wilted leaves into her wide calico
apron. “I done the best I could while they
was alive,” she said, “and mourned ’em
when I lost ’em, an’ I feel grateful to be
left so comfortable now when all is over. It
seems foolish, but I’m still at a loss about
that rose.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps you’ll feel sure when you first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>wake up in the morning,” answered Miss
Pendexter solicitously. “It’s a case where
I don’t deem myself qualified to offer you
any advice. But I’ll say one thing, seeing
’s you’ve been so friendly spoken and
confiding with me. I never was married
myself, Mis’ Bickford, because it wa’n’t so
that I could have the one I liked.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I suppose he ain’t livin’, then? Why,
I wan’t never aware you had met with
a disappointment, Abby,” said Mrs. Bickford
instantly. None of her neighbors had
ever suspected little Miss Pendexter of a
romance.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes’m, he’s livin’,” replied Miss Pendexter
humbly. “No’m, I never have heard
that he died.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want to know!” exclaimed the woman
of experience. “Well, I’ll tell you this,
Abby: you may have regretted your lot, and
felt lonesome and hardshipped, but they all
have their faults, and a single woman’s got
her liberty, if she ain’t got other blessin’s.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Twouldn’t have been my choice to live
alone,” said Abby, meeker than before. “I
feel very thankful for my blessin’s, all the
same. You’ve always been a kind neighbor,
Mis’ Bickford.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“Why can’t you stop to tea?” asked the
elder woman, with unusual cordiality; but
Miss Pendexter remembered that her hostess
often expressed a dislike for unexpected
company, and promptly took her departure
after she had risen to go, glancing up at the
bright flower as she passed outside the window.
It seemed to belong most to Albert,
but she had not liked to say so. The sun
was low; the green fields stretched away
southward into the misty distance.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>II.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Bickford’s house appeared to watch
her out of sight down the road, the next
morning. She had lost all spirit for her
holiday. Perhaps it was the unusual excitement
of the afternoon’s reminiscences,
or it might have been simply the bright
moonlight night which had kept her broad
awake until dawn, thinking of the past, and
more and more concerned about the rose.
By this time it had ceased to be merely a
flower, and had become a definite symbol
and assertion of personal choice. She found
it very difficult to decide. So much of her
present comfort and well-being was due to
Mr. Bickford; still, it was Mr. Wallis who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>had been most unfortunate, and to whom she
had done least justice. If she owed recognition
to Mr. Bickford, she certainly owed
amends to Mr. Wallis. If she gave him the
rose, it would be for the sake of affectionate
apology. And then there was Albert, to
whom she had no thought of being either indebted
or forgiving. But she could not escape
from the terrible feeling of indecision.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a beautiful morning for a drive,
but Mrs. Bickford was kept waiting some
time for the chaise. Her nephew, who was
to be her escort, had found much social advantage
at the blacksmith’s shop, so that it
was after ten when she finally started with
the three large flat-backed bouquets, covered
with a newspaper to protect them from the
sun. The petals of the almond flowers were
beginning to scatter, and now and then little
streams of water leaked out of the newspaper
and trickled down the steep slope of her best
dress to the bottom of the chaise. Even yet
she had not made up her mind; she had
stopped trying to deal with such an evasive
thing as decision, and leaned back and rested
as best she could.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What an old fool I be!” she rebuked
herself from time to time, in so loud a whisper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>that her companion ventured a respectful
“What, ma’am?” and was astonished that
she made no reply. John was a handsome
young man, but Mrs. Bickford could never
cease thinking of him as a boy. He had
always been her favorite among the younger
members of the family, and now returned
this affectionate feeling, being possessed of
an instinctive confidence in the sincerities
of his prosaic aunt.</p>

<p class='c011'>As they drove along, there had seemed
at first to be something unsympathetic and
garish about the beauty of the summer day.
After the shade and shelter of the house,
Mrs. Bickford suffered even more from a
contracted and assailed feeling out of doors.
The very trees by the roadside had a curiously
fateful, trying way of standing back to
watch her, as she passed in the acute agony
of indecision, and she was annoyed and
startled by a bird that flew too near the
chaise in a moment of surprise. She was conscious
of a strange reluctance to the movement
of the Sunday chaise, as if she were
being conveyed against her will; but the
companionship of her nephew John grew
every moment to be more and more a reliance.
It was very comfortable to sit by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>side, even though he had nothing to say; he
was manly and cheerful, and she began to
feel protected.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aunt Bickford,” he suddenly announced,
“I may ’s well out with it! I’ve got a
piece o’ news to tell you, if you won’t let on
to nobody. I expect you’ll laugh, but you
know I’ve set everything by Mary Lizzie
Gifford ever since I was a boy. Well, sir!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, sir!” exclaimed aunt Bickford
in her turn, quickly roused into most comfortable
self-forgetfulness. “I am really
pleased. She’ll make you a good, smart
wife, John. Ain’t all the folks pleased,
both sides?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, they be,” answered John soberly,
with a happy, important look that became
him well.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess I can make out to do something
for you to help along, when the right time
comes,” said aunt Bickford impulsively,
after a moment’s reflection. “I’ve known
what it is to be starting out in life with
plenty o’ hope. You ain’t calculatin’ on
gettin’ married before fall,—or be ye?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Long in the fall,” said John regretfully.
“I wish t’ we could set up for ourselves
right away this summer. I ain’t got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>much ahead, but I can work well as anybody,
an’ now I’m out o’ my time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s a nice, modest, pretty girl. I
thought she liked you, John,” said the old
aunt. “I saw her over to your mother’s,
last day I was there. Well, I expect you’ll
be happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certain,” said John, turning to look at
her affectionately, surprised by this outspokenness
and lack of embarrassment between
them. “Thank you, aunt,” he said
simply; “you’re a real good friend to
me;” and he looked away again hastily, and
blushed a fine scarlet over his sun-browned
face. “She’s coming over to spend the day
with the girls,” he added. “Mother thought
of it. You don’t get over to see us very
often.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Bickford smiled approvingly. John’s
mother looked for her good opinion, no
doubt, but it was very proper for John to
have told his prospects himself, and in such
a pretty way. There was no shilly-shallying
about the boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My gracious!” said John suddenly.
“I’d like to have drove right by the burying-ground.
I forgot we wanted to stop.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Strange as it may appear, Mrs. Bickford
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>herself had not noticed the burying-ground,
either, in her excitement and pleasure; now
she felt distressed and responsible again,
and showed it in her face at once. The
young man leaped lightly to the ground, and
reached for the flowers.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here, you just let me run up with ’em,”
he said kindly. “’Tis hot in the sun
to-day, an’ you’ll mind it risin’ the hill.
We’ll stop as I fetch you back to-night,
and you can go up comfortable an’ walk the
yard after sundown when it’s cool, an’ stay
as long as you’re a mind to. You seem
sort of tired, aunt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know but what I will let you
carry ’em,” said Mrs. Bickford slowly.</p>

<p class='c011'>To leave the matter of the rose in the
hands of fate seemed weakness and cowardice,
but there was not a moment for consideration.
John was a smiling fate, and his
proposition was a great relief. She watched
him go away with a terrible inward shaking,
and sinking of pride. She had held the
flowers with so firm a grasp that her hands
felt weak and numb, and as she leaned back
and shut her eyes she was afraid to open
them again at first for fear of knowing the
bouquets apart even at that distance, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>giving instructions which she might regret.
With a sudden impulse she called John once
or twice eagerly; but her voice had a thin
and piping sound, and the meditative early
crickets that chirped in the fresh summer
grass probably sounded louder in John’s
ears. The bright light on the white stones
dazzled Mrs. Bickford’s eyes; and then all
at once she felt light-hearted, and the sky
seemed to lift itself higher and wider from
the earth, and she gave a sigh of relief as
her messenger came back along the path.
“I know who I do hope ’s got the right
one,” she said to herself. “There, what a
touse I be in! I don’t see what I had to
go and pick the old rose for, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c012'>“I declare, they did look real handsome,
aunt,” said John’s hearty voice as he approached
the chaise. “I set ’em up just as
you told me. This one fell out, an’ I kept
it. I don’t know ’s you’ll care. I can give
it to Lizzie.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He faced her now with a bright, boyish
look. There was something gay in his buttonhole,—it
was the red rose.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aunt Bickford blushed like a girl. “Your
choice is easy made,” she faltered mysteriously,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>and then burst out laughing, there in
front of the burying-ground. “Come, get
right in, dear,” she said. “Well, well! I
guess the rose was made for you; it looks
very pretty in your coat, John.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She thought of Albert, and the next moment
the tears came into her old eyes. John
was a lover, too.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My first husband was just such a tall,
straight young man as you be,” she said as
they drove along. “The flower he first give
me was a rose.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>MISS TEMPY’S WATCHERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The time of year was April; the place was
a small farming town in New Hampshire,
remote from any railroad. One by one the
lights had been blown out in the scattered
houses near Miss Tempy Dent’s; but as her
neighbors took a last look out-of-doors, their
eyes turned with instinctive curiosity toward
the old house, where a lamp burned steadily.
They gave a little sigh. “Poor Miss Tempy!”
said more than one bereft acquaintance;
for the good woman lay dead in her
north chamber, and the light was a watcher’s
light. The funeral was set for the next
day, at one o’clock.</p>

<p class='c011'>The watchers were two of the oldest
friends, Mrs. Crowe and Sarah Ann Binson.
They were sitting in the kitchen, because it
seemed less awesome than the unused best
room, and they beguiled the long hours by
steady conversation. One would think that
neither topics nor opinions would hold out,
at that rate, all through the long spring
night; but there was a certain degree of excitement
just then, and the two women had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>risen to an unusual level of expressiveness
and confidence. Each had already told the
other more than one fact that she had determined
to keep secret; they were again and
again tempted into statements that either
would have found impossible by daylight.
Mrs. Crowe was knitting a blue yarn stocking
for her husband; the foot was already
so long that it seemed as if she must have
forgotten to narrow it at the proper time.
Mrs. Crowe knew exactly what she was
about, however; she was of a much cooler
disposition than Sister Binson, who made
futile attempts at some sewing, only to drop
her work into her lap whenever the talk was
most engaging.</p>

<p class='c011'>Their faces were interesting,—of the dry,
shrewd, quick-witted New England type,
with thin hair twisted neatly back out of the
way. Mrs. Crowe could look vague and benignant,
and Miss Binson was, to quote her
neighbors, a little too sharp-set; but the
world knew that she had need to be, with the
load she must carry of supporting an inefficient
widowed sister and six unpromising
and unwilling nieces and nephews. The eldest
boy was at last placed with a good man
to learn the mason’s trade. Sarah Ann Binson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>for all her sharp, anxious aspect, never
defended herself, when her sister whined
and fretted. She was told every week of her
life that the poor children never would have
had to lift a finger if their father had lived,
and yet she had kept her steadfast way with
the little farm, and patiently taught the
young people many useful things, for which,
as everybody said, they would live to thank
her. However pleasureless her life appeared
to outward view, it was brimful of pleasure
to herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Crowe, on the contrary, was well to
do, her husband being a rich farmer and an
easy-going man. She was a stingy woman,
but for all that she looked kindly; and when
she gave away anything, or lifted a finger to
help anybody, it was thought a great piece
of beneficence, and a compliment, indeed,
which the recipient accepted with twice as
much gratitude as double the gift that came
from a poorer and more generous acquaintance.
Everybody liked to be on good terms
with Mrs. Crowe. Socially she stood much
higher than Sarah Ann Binson. They were
both old schoolmates and friends of Temperance
Dent, who had asked them, one day,
not long before she died, if they would not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>come together and look after the house, and
manage everything, when she was gone. She
may have had some hope that they might
become closer friends in this period of intimate
partnership, and that the richer woman
might better understand the burdens of the
poorer. They had not kept the house the
night before; they were too weary with the
care of their old friend, whom they had not
left until all was over.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a brook which ran down the
hillside very near the house, and the sound
of it was much louder than usual. When
there was silence in the kitchen, the busy
stream had a strange insistence in its wild
voice, as if it tried to make the watchers understand
something that related to the past.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I declare, I can’t begin to sorrow for
Tempy yet. I am so glad to have her at
rest,” whispered Mrs. Crowe. “It is strange
to set here without her, but I can’t make it
clear that she has gone. I feel as if she had
got easy and dropped off to sleep, and I’m
more scared about waking her up than knowing
any other feeling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” said Sarah Ann, “It’s just like
that, ain’t it? But I tell you we are goin’
to miss her worse than we expect. She’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>helped me through with many a trial, has
Temperance. I ain’t the only one who says
the same, neither.”</p>

<p class='c011'>These words were spoken as if there were
a third person listening; somebody beside
Mrs. Crowe. The watchers could not rid
their minds of the feeling that they were
being watched themselves. The spring wind
whistled in the window crack, now and then,
and buffeted the little house in a gusty way
that had a sort of companionable effect.
Yet, on the whole, it was a very still night,
and the watchers spoke in a half-whisper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was the freest-handed woman that
ever I knew,” said Mrs. Crowe, decidedly.
“According to her means, she gave away
more than anybody. I used to tell her
’t wa’n’t right. I used really to be afraid
that she went without too much, for we have
a duty to ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sister Binson looked up in a half-amused,
unconscious way, and then recollected herself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Crowe met her look with a serious
face. “It ain’t so easy for me to give as it
is for some,” she said simply, but with an effort
which was made possible only by the occasion.
“I should like to say, while Tempy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>is laying here yet in her own house, that she
has been a constant lesson to me. Folks are
too kind, and shame me with thanks for what
I do. I ain’t such a generous woman as
poor Tempy was, for all she had nothin’ to
do with, as one may say.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sarah Binson was much moved at this
confession, and was even pained and touched
by the unexpected humility. “You have a
good many calls on you”—she began, and
then left her kind little compliment half finished.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes, but I’ve got means enough.
My disposition’s more of a cross to me as
I grow older, and I made up my mind this
morning that Tempy’s example should be
my pattern henceforth.” She began to knit
faster than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tain’t no use to get morbid: that’s
what Tempy used to say herself,” said Sarah
Ann, after a minute’s silence. “Ain’t it
strange to say ‘used to say’?” and her own
voice choked a little. “She never did like
to hear folks git goin’ about themselves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Twas only because they’re apt to do it
so as other folks will say’t wasn’t so, an’
praise ’em up,” humbly replied Mrs. Crowe,
“and that ain’t my object. There wa’n’t a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>child but what Tempy set herself to work
to see what she could do to please it. One
time my brother’s folks had been stopping
here in the summer, from Massachusetts.
The children was all little, and they broke
up a sight of toys, and left ’em when they
were going away. Tempy come right up
after they rode by, to see if she couldn’t
help me set the house to rights, and she
caught me just as I was going to fling some
of the clutter into the stove. I was kind of
tired out, starting ’em off in season. ‘Oh,
give me them!’ says she, real pleading; and
she wropped ’em up and took ’em home with
her when she went, and she mended ’em up
and stuck ’em together, and made some young
one or other happy with every blessed one.
You’d thought I’d done her the biggest
favor. ‘No thanks to me. I should ha’
burnt ’em, Tempy,’ says I.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some of ’em came to our house, I know,”
said Miss Binson. “She’d take a lot o’
trouble to please a child, ’stead o’ shoving of
it out o’ the way, like the rest of us when
we’re drove.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can tell you the biggest thing she ever
done, and I don’t know ’s there’s anybody
left but me to tell it. I don’t want it forgot,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>Sarah Binson went on, looking up at
the clock to see how the night was going.
“It was that pretty-looking Trevor girl, who
taught the Corners school, and married so
well afterwards, out in New York State.
You remember her, I dare say?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certain,” said Mrs. Crowe, with an air
of interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was a splendid scholar, folks said,
and give the school a great start; but she’d
overdone herself getting her education, and
working to pay for it, and she all broke down
one spring, and Tempy made her come and
stop with her a while,—you remember
that? Well, she had an uncle, her mother’s
brother, out in Chicago, who was well off
and friendly, and used to write to Lizzie
Trevor, and I dare say make her some presents;
but he was a lively, driving man, and
didn’t take time to stop and think about his
folks. He hadn’t seen her since she was a
little girl. Poor Lizzie was so pale and weakly
that she just got through the term o’ school.
She looked as if she was just going straight
off in a decline. Tempy, she cosseted her
up a while, and then, next thing folks knew,
she was tellin’ round how Miss Trevor had
gone to see her uncle, and meant to visit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Niagary Falls on the way, and stop over
night. Now I happened to know, in ways
I won’t dwell on to explain, that the poor
girl was in debt for her schoolin’ when she
come here, and her last quarter’s pay had
just squared it off at last, and left her without
a cent ahead, hardly; but it had fretted her
thinking of it, so she paid it all; those might
have dunned her that she owed it to. An’
I taxed Tempy about the girl’s goin’ off on
such a journey till she owned up, rather’n
have Lizzie blamed, that she’d given her
sixty dollars, same’s if she was rolling in
riches, and sent her off to have a good rest
and vacation.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sixty dollars!” exclaimed Mrs. Crowe.
“Tempy only had ninety dollars a year that
came in to her; rest of her livin’ she got by
helpin’ about, with what she raised off this
little piece o’ ground, sand one side an’ clay
the other. An’ how often I’ve heard her
tell, years ago, that she’d rather see Niagary
than any other sight in the world!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The women looked at each other in silence;
the magnitude of the generous sacrifice
was almost too great for their comprehension.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was just poor enough to do that!”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>declared Mrs. Crowe at last, in an abandonment
of feeling. “Say what you may, I feel
humbled to the dust,” and her companion
ventured to say nothing. She never had
given away sixty dollars at once, but it was
simply because she never had it to give. It
came to her very lips to say in explanation,
“Tempy was so situated;” but she checked
herself in time, for she would not betray
her own loyal guarding of a dependent
household.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Folks say a great deal of generosity, and
this one’s being public-sperited, and that
one free-handed about giving,” said Mrs.
Crowe, who was a little nervous in the silence.
“I suppose we can’t tell the sorrow it would
be to some folks not to give, same’s ’twould
be to me not to save. I seem kind of made
for that, as if ’twas what I’d got to do. I
should feel sights better about it if I could
make it evident what I was savin’ for. If I
had a child, now, Sarah Ann,” and her voice
was a little husky,—“if I had a child, I
should think I was heapin’ of it up because
he was the one trained by the Lord to scatter
it again for good. But here’s Mr. Crowe
and me, we can’t do anything with money,
and both of us like to keep things same ’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>they’ve always been. Now Priscilla Dance
was talking away like a mill-clapper, week
before last. She’d think I would go right
off and get one o’ them new-fashioned gilt-and-white
papers for the best room, and some
new furniture, an’ a marble-top table. And
I looked at her, all struck up. ‘Why,’ says
I, ‘Priscilla, that nice old velvet paper ain’t
hurt a mite. I shouldn’t feel ’twas my best
room without it. Dan’el says ’tis the first
thing he can remember rubbin’ his little baby
fingers on to it, and how splendid he thought
them red roses was.’ I maintain,” continued
Mrs. Crowe stoutly, “that folks wastes sights
o’ good money doin’ just such foolish things.
Tearin’ out the insides o’ meetin’-houses,
and fixin’ the pews different; ’twas good
enough as ’twas with mendin’; then times
come, an’ they want to put it all back same ’s
’twas before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This touched upon an exciting subject to
active members of that parish. Miss Binson
and Mrs. Crowe belonged to opposite
parties, and had at one time come as near
hard feelings as they could, and yet escape
them. Each hastened to speak of other
things and to show her untouched friendliness.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“I do agree with you,” said Sister Binson,
“that few of us know what use to make
of money, beyond every-day necessities.
You’ve seen more o’ the world than I have,
and know what’s expected. When it comes
to taste and judgment about such things, I
ought to defer to others;” and with this
modest avowal the critical moment passed
when there might have been an improper
discussion.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the silence that followed, the fact of
their presence in a house of death grew more
clear than before. There was something
disturbing in the noise of a mouse gnawing
at the dry boards of a closet wall near by.
Both the watchers looked up anxiously at
the clock; it was almost the middle of the
night, and the whole world seemed to have
left them alone with their solemn duty.
Only the brook was awake.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps we might give a look upstairs
now,” whispered Mrs. Crowe, as if she
hoped to hear some reason against their going
just then to the chamber of death; but
Sister Binson rose, with a serious and yet
satisfied countenance, and lifted the small
lamp from the table. She was much more
used to watching than Mrs. Crowe, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>much less affected by it. They opened the
door into a small entry with a steep stairway;
they climbed the creaking stairs, and
entered the cold upper room on tiptoe. Mrs.
Crowe’s heart began to beat very fast as
the lamp was put on a high bureau, and
made long, fixed shadows about the walls.
She went hesitatingly toward the solemn
shape under its white drapery, and felt a
sense of remonstrance as Sarah Ann gently,
but in a business-like way, turned back the
thin sheet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Seems to me she looks pleasanter and
pleasanter,” whispered Sarah Ann Binson
impulsively, as they gazed at the white face
with its wonderful smile. “To-morrow ’twill
all have faded out. I do believe they
kind of wake up a day or two after they die,
and it’s then they go.” She replaced the
light covering, and they both turned quickly
away; there was a chill in this upper room.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis a great thing for anybody to have
got through, ain’t it?” said Mrs. Crowe
softly, as she began to go down the stairs
on tiptoe. The warm air from the kitchen
beneath met them with a sense of welcome
and shelter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’ know why it is, but I feel as near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>again to Tempy down here as I do up there,”
replied Sister Binson. “I feel as if the air
was full of her, kind of. I can sense things,
now and then, that she seems to say. Now
I never was one to take up with no nonsense
of sperits and such, but I declare I felt as if
she told me just now to put some more wood
into the stove.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Crowe preserved a gloomy silence.
She had suspected before this that her companion
was of a weaker and more credulous
disposition than herself. “’Tis a great
thing to have got through,” she repeated,
ignoring definitely all that had last been
said. “I suppose you know as well as I
that Tempy was one that always feared
death. Well, it’s all put behind her now;
she knows what ’tis.” Mrs. Crowe gave a
little sigh, and Sister Binson’s quick sympathies
were stirred toward this other old
friend, who also dreaded the great change.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d never like to forgit almost those last
words Tempy spoke plain to me,” she said
gently, like the comforter she truly was.
“She looked up at me once or twice, that
last afternoon after I come to set by her, and
let Mis’ Owen go home; and I says, ‘Can I
do anything to ease you, Tempy?’ and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>tears come into my eyes so I couldn’t see
what kind of a nod she give me. ‘No, Sarah
Ann, you can’t, dear,’ says she; and then
she got her breath again, and says she, looking
at me real meanin’, ‘I’m only a-gettin’
sleepier and sleepier; that’s all there is,’ says
she, and smiled up at me kind of wishful,
and shut her eyes. I knew well enough
all she meant. She’d been lookin’ out for
a chance to tell me, and I don’ know ’s she
ever said much afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Crowe was not knitting; she had been
listening too eagerly. “Yes, ’twill be a
comfort to think of that sometimes,” she
said, in acknowledgment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know that old Dr. Prince said once,
in evenin’ meetin’, that he’d watched by
many a dyin’ bed, as we well knew, and
enough o’ his sick folks had been scared o’
dyin’ their whole lives through; but when
they come to the last, he’d never seen one
but was willin’, and most were glad, to go.
‘’Tis as natural as bein’ born or livin’ on,’
he said. I don’t know what had moved him
to speak that night. You know he wa’n’t
in the habit of it, and ’twas the monthly
concert of prayer for foreign missions anyways,”
said Sarah Ann; “but ’twas a great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>stay to the mind to listen to his words of experience.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There never was a better man,” responded
Mrs. Crowe, in a really cheerful
tone. She had recovered from her feeling
of nervous dread, the kitchen was so comfortable
with lamplight and firelight; and
just then the old clock began to tell the hour
of twelve with leisurely whirring strokes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sister Binson laid aside her work, and
rose quickly and went to the cupboard.
“We’d better take a little to eat,” she explained.
“The night will go fast after this.
I want to know if you went and made some
o’ your nice cupcake, while you was home
to-day?” she asked, in a pleased tone; and
Mrs. Crowe acknowledged such a gratifying
piece of thoughtfulness for this humble
friend who denied herself all luxuries.
Sarah Ann brewed a generous cup of tea,
and the watchers drew their chairs up to
the table presently, and quelled their hunger
with good country appetites. Sister Binson
put a spoon into a small, old-fashioned
glass of preserved quince, and passed it to
her friend. She was most familiar with
the house, and played the part of hostess.
“Spread some o’ this on your bread and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>butter,” she said to Mrs. Crowe. “Tempy
wanted me to use some three or four times,
but I never felt to. I know she’d like to
have us comfortable now, and would urge
us to make a good supper, poor dear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What excellent preserves she did make!”
mourned Mrs. Crowe. “None of us has got
her light hand at doin’ things tasty. She
made the most o’ everything, too. Now, she
only had that one old quince-tree down in the
far corner of the piece, but she’d go out in
the spring and tend to it, and look at it so
pleasant, and kind of expect the old thorny
thing into bloomin’.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was just the same with folks,” said
Sarah Ann. “And she’d never git more ’n
a little apernful o’ quinces, but she’d have
every mite o’ goodness out o’ those, and set
the glasses up onto her best-room closet
shelf, <em>so</em> pleased. ‘T wa’n’t but a week ago
to-morrow mornin’ I fetched her a little taste
o’ jelly in a teaspoon; and she says ‘Thank
ye,’ and took it, an’ the minute she tasted it
she looked up at me as worried as could
be. ‘Oh, I don’t want to eat that,’ says she.
‘I always keep that in case o’ sickness.’
‘You’re goin’ to have the good o’ one tumbler
yourself,’ says I. ‘I’d just like to know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>who’s sick now, if you ain’t!’ An’ she
couldn’t help laughin’, I spoke up so smart.
Oh, dear me, how I shall miss talkin’ over
things with her! She always sensed things,
and got just the p’int you meant.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She didn’t begin to age until two or three
years ago, did she?” asked Mrs. Crowe.
“I never saw anybody keep her looks as
Tempy did. She looked young long after
I begun to feel like an old woman. The
doctor used to say ’twas her young heart,
and I don’t know but what he was right.
How she did do for other folks! There was
one spell she wasn’t at home a day to a fortnight.
She got most of her livin’ so, and
that made her own potatoes and things last
her through. None o’ the young folks could
get married without her, and all the old ones
was disappointed if she wa’n’t round when
they was down with sickness and had to go.
An’ cleanin’, or tailorin’ for boys, or rug-hookin’,—there
was nothin’ but what she
could do as handy as most. ‘I do love to
work,’—ain’t you heard her say that twenty
times a week?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Sarah Ann Binson nodded, and began to
clear away the empty plates. “We may
want a taste o’ somethin’ more towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>mornin’,” she said. “There’s plenty in the
closet here; and in case some comes from a
distance to the funeral, we’ll have a little
table spread after we get back to the house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I was busy all the mornin’. I’ve
cooked up a sight o’ things to bring over,”
said Mrs. Crowe. “I felt ’twas the last I
could do for her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They drew their chairs near the stove
again, and took up their work. Sister Binson’s
rocking-chair creaked as she rocked;
the brook sounded louder than ever. It was
more lonely when nobody spoke, and presently
Mrs. Crowe returned to her thoughts
of growing old.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Tempy aged all of a sudden. I remember
I asked her if she felt as well as
common, one day, and she laughed at me
good. There, when Mr. Crowe begun to look
old, I couldn’t help feeling as if somethin’
ailed him, and like as not ’twas somethin’
he was goin’ to git right over, and I dosed
him for it stiddy, half of one summer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How many things we shall be wanting
to ask Tempy!” exclaimed Sarah Ann Binson,
after a long pause. “I can’t make up
my mind to doin’ without her. I wish folks
could come back just once, and tell us how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>’tis where they’ve gone. Seems then we
could do without ’em better.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The brook hurried on, the wind blew about
the house now and then; the house itself was
a silent place, and the supper, the warm fire,
and an absence of any new topics for conversation
made the watchers drowsy. Sister
Binson closed her eyes first, to rest them for
a minute; and Mrs. Crowe glanced at her
compassionately, with a new sympathy for
the hard-worked little woman. She made
up her mind to let Sarah Ann have a good
rest, while she kept watch alone; but in a
few minutes her own knitting was dropped,
and she, too, fell asleep. Overhead, the
pale shape of Tempy Dent, the outworn
body of that generous, loving-hearted, simple
soul, slept on also in its white raiment.
Perhaps Tempy herself stood near, and saw
her own life and its surroundings with new
understanding. Perhaps she herself was the
only watcher.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later, by some hours, Sarah Ann Binson
woke with a start. There was a pale light
of dawn outside the small windows. Inside
the kitchen, the lamp burned dim. Mrs.
Crowe awoke, too.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“I think Tempy’d be the first to say
’twas just as well we both had some rest,”
she said, not without a guilty feeling.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her companion went to the outer door,
and opened it wide. The fresh air was none
too cold, and the brook’s voice was not
nearly so loud as it had been in the midnight
darkness. She could see the shapes of the
hills, and the great shadows that lay across
the lower country. The east was fast growing
bright.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Twill be a beautiful day for the funeral,”
she said, and turned again, with a
sigh, to follow Mrs. Crowe up the stairs.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>MARTHA’S LADY.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>I.</h3>

<p class='c010'>One day, many years ago, the old Judge
Pyne house wore an unwonted look of gayety
and youthfulness. The high-fenced
green garden was bright with June flowers.
Under the elms in the large shady front
yard you might see some chairs placed near
together, as they often used to be when the
family were all at home and life was going
on gayly with eager talk and pleasure-making;
when the elder judge, the grandfather,
used to quote that great author, Dr. Johnson,
and say to his girls, “Be brisk, be splendid,
and be public.”</p>

<p class='c011'>One of the chairs had a crimson silk
shawl thrown carelessly over its straight back,
and a passer-by, who looked in through the
latticed gate between the tall gate-posts with
their white urns, might think that this piece
of shining East Indian color was a huge red
lily that had suddenly bloomed against the
syringa bush. There were certain windows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>thrown wide open that were usually shut,
and their curtains were blowing free in the
light wind of a summer afternoon; it looked
as if a large household had returned to the
old house to fill the prim best rooms and find
them full of cheer.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was evident to every one in town that
Miss Harriet Pyne, to use the village phrase,
had company. She was the last of her family,
and was by no means old; but being the
last, and wonted to live with people much
older than herself, she had formed all the
habits of a serious elderly person. Ladies
of her age, something past thirty, often wore
discreet caps in those days, especially if they
were married, but being single, Miss Harriet
clung to youth in this respect, making
the one concession of keeping her waving
chestnut hair as smooth and stiffly arranged
as possible. She had been the dutiful companion
of her father and mother in their
latest years, all her elder brothers and sisters
having married and gone, or died and gone,
out of the old house. Now that she was left
alone it seemed quite the best thing frankly
to accept the fact of age, and to turn more
resolutely than ever to the companionship of
duty and serious books. She was more serious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>and given to routine than her elders
themselves, as sometimes happened when the
daughters of New England gentlefolks were
brought up wholly in the society of their
elders. At thirty-five she had more reluctance
than her mother to face an unforeseen
occasion, certainly more than her grandmother,
who had preserved some cheerful
inheritance of gayety and worldliness from
colonial times.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was something about the look of
the crimson silk shawl in the front yard to
make one suspect that the sober customs of
the best house in a quiet New England village
were all being set at defiance, and once
when the mistress of the house came to stand
in her own doorway, she wore the pleased but
somewhat apprehensive look of a guest. In
these days New England life held the necessity
of much dignity and discretion of behavior;
there was the truest hospitality and good
cheer in all occasional festivities, but it was
sometimes a self-conscious hospitality, followed
by an inexorable return to asceticism
both of diet and of behavior. Miss Harriet
Pyne belonged to the very dullest days
of New England, those which perhaps held
the most priggishness for the learned professions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the most limited interpretation of
the word “evangelical,” and the pettiest indifference
to large things. The outbreak of
a desire for larger religious freedom caused
at first a most determined reaction toward
formalism, especially in small and quiet villages
like Ashford, intently busy with their
own concerns. It was high time for a little
leaven to begin its work, in this moment
when the great impulses of the war for liberty
had died away and those of the coming
war for patriotism and a new freedom had
hardly yet begun.</p>

<p class='c012'>The dull interior, the changed life of the
old house, whose former activities seemed to
have fallen sound asleep, really typified these
larger conditions, and a little leaven had
made its easily recognized appearance in the
shape of a light-hearted girl. She was Miss
Harriet’s young Boston cousin, Helena Vernon,
who, half-amused and half-impatient
at the unnecessary sober-mindedness of her
hostess and of Ashford in general, had set
herself to the difficult task of gayety. Cousin
Harriet looked on at a succession of ingenious
and, on the whole, innocent attempts at
pleasure, as she might have looked on at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>frolics of a kitten who easily substitutes a
ball of yarn for the uncertainties of a bird
or a wind-blown leaf, and who may at any
moment ravel the fringe of a sacred curtain-tassel
in preference to either.</p>

<p class='c011'>Helena, with her mischievous appealing
eyes, with her enchanting old songs and her
guitar, seemed the more delightful and even
reasonable because she was so kind to everybody,
and because she was a beauty. She
had the gift of most charming manners.
There was all the unconscious lovely ease
and grace that had come with the good breeding
of her city home, where many pleasant
people came and went; she had no fear, one
had almost said no respect, of the individual,
and she did not need to think of herself.
Cousin Harriet turned cold with apprehension
when she saw the minister coming in at
the front gate, and wondered in agony if
Martha were properly attired to go to the
door, and would by any chance hear the
knocker; it was Helena who, delighted to
have anything happen, ran to the door to
welcome the Reverend Mr. Crofton as if he
were a congenial friend of her own age.
She could behave with more or less propriety
during the stately first visit, and even contrive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>to lighten it with modest mirth, and to
extort the confession that the guest had a
tenor voice, though sadly out of practice;
but when the minister departed a little flattered,
and hoping that he had not expressed
himself too strongly for a pastor upon the
poems of Emerson, and feeling the unusual
stir of gallantry in his proper heart, it was
Helena who caught the honored hat of the
late Judge Pyne from its last resting-place
in the hall, and holding it securely in both
hands, mimicked the minister’s self-conscious
entrance. She copied his pompous and anxious
expression in the dim parlor in such
delicious fashion that Miss Harriet, who
could not always extinguish a ready spark
of the original sin of humor, laughed aloud.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My dear!” she exclaimed severely the
next moment, “I am ashamed of your being
so disrespectful!” and then laughed
again, and took the affecting old hat and
carried it back to its place.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I would not have had any one else see
you for the world,” she said sorrowfully as
she returned, feeling quite self-possessed
again, to the parlor doorway; but Helena
still sat in the minister’s chair, with her
small feet placed as his stiff boots had been,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>and a copy of his solemn expression before
they came to speaking of Emerson and of
the guitar. “I wish I had asked him if he
would be so kind as to climb the cherry-tree,”
said Helena, unbending a little at the
discovery that her cousin would consent to
laugh no more. “There are all those ripe
cherries on the top branches. I can climb
as high as he, but I can’t reach far enough
from the last branch that will bear me.
The minister is so long and thin”—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know what Mr. Crofton would
have thought of you; he is a very serious
young man,” said cousin Harriet, still
ashamed of her laughter. “Martha will get
the cherries for you, or one of the men. I
should not like to have Mr. Crofton think
you were frivolous, a young lady of your
opportunities”—but Helena had escaped
through the hall and out at the garden door
at the mention of Martha’s name. Miss
Harriet Pyne sighed anxiously, and then
smiled, in spite of her deep convictions, as
she shut the blinds and tried to make the
house look solemn again.</p>

<p class='c011'>The front door might be shut, but the
garden door at the other end of the broad
hall was wide open upon the large sunshiny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>garden, where the last of the red and white
peonies and the golden lilies, and the first
of the tall blue larkspurs lent their colors in
generous fashion. The straight box borders
were all in fresh and shining green of their
new leaves, and there was a fragrance of the
old garden’s inmost life and soul blowing
from the honeysuckle blossoms on a long trellis.
It was now late in the afternoon, and
the sun was low behind great apple-trees at
the garden’s end, which threw their shadows
over the short turf of the bleaching-green.
The cherry-trees stood at one side in full sunshine,
and Miss Harriet, who presently came
to the garden steps to watch like a hen at
the water’s edge, saw her cousin’s pretty
figure in its white dress of India muslin hurrying
across the grass. She was accompanied
by the tall, ungainly shape of Martha
the new maid, who, dull and indifferent to
every one else, showed a surprising willingness
and allegiance to the young guest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Martha ought to be in the dining-room,
already, slow as she is; it wants but half
an hour of tea-time,” said Miss Harriet, as
she turned and went into the shaded house.
It was Martha’s duty to wait at table,
and there had been many trying scenes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>and defeated efforts toward her education.
Martha was certainly very clumsy, and she
seemed the clumsier because she had replaced
her aunt, a most skillful person, who had
but lately married a thriving farm and its
prosperous owner. It must be confessed
that Miss Harriet was a most bewildering
instructor, and that her pupil’s brain was
easily confused and prone to blunders.
The coming of Helena had been somewhat
dreaded by reason of this incompetent service,
but the guest took no notice of frowns
or futile gestures at the first tea-table, except
to establish friendly relations with
Martha on her own account by a reassuring
smile. They were about the same age, and
next morning, before cousin Harriet came
down, Helena showed by a word and a
quick touch the right way to do something
that had gone wrong and been impossible to
understand the night before. A moment
later the anxious mistress came in without
suspicion, but Martha’s eyes were as affectionate
as a dog’s, and there was a new look
of hopefulness on her face; this dreaded
guest was a friend after all, and not a foe
come from proud Boston to confound her
ignorance and patient efforts.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>The two young creatures, mistress and
maid, were hurrying across the bleaching-green.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can’t reach the ripest cherries,” explained
Helena politely, “and I think that
Miss Pyne ought to send some to the minister.
He has just made us a call. Why,
Martha, you haven’t been crying again!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes’m,” said Martha sadly. “Miss
Pyne always loves to send something to the
minister,” she acknowledged with interest,
as if she did not wish to be asked to explain
these latest tears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’ll arrange some of the best cherries
in a pretty dish. I’ll show you how, and
you shall carry them over to the parsonage
after tea,” said Helena cheerfully, and Martha
accepted the embassy with pleasure.
Life was beginning to hold moments of something
like delight in the last few days.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You’ll spoil your pretty dress, Miss
Helena,” Martha gave shy warning, and
Miss Helena stood back and held up her
skirts with unusual care while the country
girl, in her heavy blue checked gingham,
began to climb the cherry-tree like a boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Down came the scarlet fruit like bright
rain into the green grass.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“Break some nice twigs with the cherries
and leaves together; oh, you’re a duck,
Martha!” and Martha, flushed with delight,
and looking far more like a thin and solemn
blue heron, came rustling down to earth
again, and gathered the spoils into her clean
apron.</p>

<p class='c011'>That night at tea, during her handmaiden’s
temporary absence, Miss Harriet
announced, as if by way of apology, that she
thought Martha was beginning to understand
something about her work. “Her
aunt was a treasure, she never had to be told
anything twice; but Martha has been as
clumsy as a calf,” said the precise mistress
of the house. “I have been afraid sometimes
that I never could teach her anything.
I was quite ashamed to have you come just
now, and find me so unprepared to entertain
a visitor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Martha will learn fast enough because
she cares so much,” said the visitor
eagerly. “I think she is a dear good girl.
I do hope that she will never go away. I
think she does things better every day, cousin
Harriet,” added Helena pleadingly, with
all her kind young heart. The china-closet
door was open a little way, and Martha heard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>every word. From that moment, she not
only knew what love was like, but she knew
love’s dear ambitions. To have come from
a stony hill farm and a bare small wooden
house, was like a cave-dweller’s coming to
make a permanent home in an art museum,
such had seemed the elaborateness and elegance
of Miss Pyne’s fashion of life; and
Martha’s simple brain was slow enough in
its processes and recognitions. But with
this sympathetic ally and defender, this exquisite
Miss Helena who believed in her, all
difficulties appeared to vanish.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later that evening, no longer homesick
or hopeless, Martha returned from her polite
errand to the minister, and stood with a
sort of triumph before the two ladies, who
were sitting in the front doorway, as if they
were waiting for visitors, Helena still in her
white muslin and red ribbons, and Miss
Harriet in a thin black silk. Being happily
self-forgetful in the greatness of the moment,
Martha’s manners were perfect, and she
looked for once almost pretty and quite as
young as she was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The minister came to the door himself,
and returned his thanks. He said that cherries
were always his favorite fruit, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>was much obliged to both Miss Pyne and
Miss Vernon. He kept me waiting a few
minutes, while he got this book ready to
send to you, Miss Helena.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What are you saying, Martha? I have
sent him nothing!” exclaimed Miss Pyne,
much astonished. “What does she mean,
Helena?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only a few cherries,” explained Helena.
“I thought Mr. Crofton would like them
after his afternoon of parish calls. Martha
and I arranged them before tea, and I sent
them with our compliments.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I am very glad you did,” said Miss
Harriet, wondering, but much relieved. “I
was afraid”—</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, it was none of my mischief,” answered
Helena daringly. “I did not think
that Martha would be ready to go so soon.
I should have shown you how pretty they
looked among their green leaves. We put
them in one of your best white dishes with
the openwork edge. Martha shall show you
to-morrow; mamma always likes to have
them so.” Helena’s fingers were busy with
the hard knot of a parcel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“See this, cousin Harriet!” she announced
proudly, as Martha disappeared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>round the corner of the house, beaming with
the pleasures of adventure and success.
“Look! the minister has sent me a book:
Sermons on <em>what</em>? Sermons—it is so dark
that I can’t quite see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be his ‘Sermons on the Seriousness
of Life;’ they are the only ones he has
printed, I believe,” said Miss Harriet, with
much pleasure. “They are considered very
fine discourses. He pays you a great compliment,
my dear. I feared that he noticed
your girlish levity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I behaved beautifully while he stayed,”
insisted Helena. “Ministers are only men,”
but she blushed with pleasure. It was certainly
something to receive a book from its
author, and such a tribute made her of more
value to the whole reverent household. The
minister was not only a man, but a bachelor,
and Helena was at the age that best loves
conquest; it was at any rate comfortable to
be reinstated in cousin Harriet’s good graces.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do ask the kind gentleman to tea! He
needs a little cheering up,” begged the siren
in India muslin, as she laid the shiny black
volume of sermons on the stone doorstep
with an air of approval, but as if they had
quite finished their mission.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>“Perhaps I shall, if Martha improves as
much as she has within the last day or two,”
Miss Harriet promised hopefully. “It is
something I always dread a little when I
am all alone, but I think Mr. Crofton likes
to come. He converses so elegantly.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>II.</h3>

<p class='c010'>These were the days of long visits, before
affectionate friends thought it quite worth
while to take a hundred miles’ journey
merely to dine or to pass a night in one
another’s houses. Helena lingered through
the pleasant weeks of early summer, and
departed unwillingly at last to join her
family at the White Hills, where they had
gone, like other households of high social
station, to pass the month of August out of
town. The happy-hearted young guest left
many lamenting friends behind her, and
promised each that she would come back
again next year. She left the minister a
rejected lover, as well as the preceptor of
the academy, but with their pride unwounded,
and it may have been with wider
outlooks upon the world and a less narrow
sympathy both for their own work in life and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>for their neighbors’ work and hindrances.
Even Miss Harriet Pyne herself had lost
some of the unnecessary provincialism and
prejudice which had begun to harden a
naturally good and open mind and affectionate
heart. She was conscious of feeling
younger and more free, and not so lonely.
Nobody had ever been so gay, so fascinating,
or so kind as Helena, so full of social
resource, so simple and undemanding in her
friendliness. The light of her young life
cast no shadow on either young or old companions,
her pretty clothes never seemed to
make other girls look dull or out of fashion.
When she went away up the street in Miss
Harriet’s carriage to take the slow train
toward Boston and the gayeties of the new
Profile House, where her mother waited impatiently
with a group of Southern friends,
it seemed as if there would never be any
more picnics or parties in Ashford, and as if
society had nothing left to do but to grow
old and get ready for winter.</p>

<p class='c012'>Martha came into Miss Helena’s bedroom
that last morning, and it was easy to
see that she had been crying; she looked
just as she did in that first sad week of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>homesickness and despair. All for love’s
sake she had been learning to do many
things, and to do them exactly right; her
eyes had grown quick to see the smallest
chance for personal service. Nobody could
be more humble and devoted; she looked
years older than Helena, and wore already a
touching air of caretaking.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You spoil me, you dear Martha!” said
Helena from the bed. “I don’t know what
they will say at home, I am so spoiled.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Martha went on opening the blinds to let
in the brightness of the summer morning,
but she did not speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are getting on splendidly, aren’t
you?” continued the little mistress. “You
have tried so hard that you make me
ashamed of myself. At first you crammed
all the flowers together, and now you make
them look beautiful. Last night cousin
Harriet was so pleased when the table was
so charming, and I told her that you did
everything yourself, every bit. Won’t you
keep the flowers fresh and pretty in the
house until I come back? It’s so much
pleasanter for Miss Pyne, and you’ll feed
my little sparrows, won’t you? They’re
growing so tame.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“Oh, yes, Miss Helena!” and Martha
looked almost angry for a moment, then she
burst into tears and covered her face with
her apron. “I couldn’t understand a single
thing when I first came. I never had been
anywhere to see anything, and Miss Pyne
frightened me when she talked. It was you
made me think I could ever learn. I wanted
to keep the place, ’count of mother and the
little boys; we’re dreadful hard pushed.
Hepsy has been good in the kitchen; she said
she ought to have patience with me, for she
was awkward herself when she first came.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Helena laughed; she looked so pretty
under the tasseled white curtains.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I dare say Hepsy tells the truth,” she
said. “I wish you had told me about your
mother. When I come again, some day
we’ll drive up country, as you call it, to see
her. Martha! I wish you would think of
me sometimes after I go away. Won’t you
promise?” and the bright young face suddenly
grew grave. “I have hard times myself;
I don’t always learn things that I
ought to learn, I don’t always put things
straight. I wish you wouldn’t forget me
ever, and would just believe in me. I think
it does help more than anything.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>“I won’t forget,” said Martha slowly.
“I shall think of you every day.” She
spoke almost with indifference, as if she had
been asked to dust a room, but she turned
aside quickly and pulled the little mat under
the hot water jug quite out of its former
straightness; then she hastened away down
the long white entry, weeping as she went.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>III.</h3>

<p class='c010'>To lose out of sight the friend whom one
has loved and lived to please is to lose joy
out of life. But if love is true, there comes
presently a higher joy of pleasing the ideal,
that is to say, the perfect friend. The same
old happiness is lifted to a higher level.
As for Martha, the girl who stayed behind
in Ashford, nobody’s life could seem duller
to those who could not understand; she
was slow of step, and her eyes were almost
always downcast as if intent upon incessant
toil; but they startled you when she looked
up, with their shining light. She was capable
of the happiness of holding fast to a
great sentiment, the ineffable satisfaction of
trying to please one whom she truly loved.
She never thought of trying to make other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>people pleased with herself; all she lived
for was to do the best she could for others,
and to conform to an ideal, which grew at
last to be like a saint’s vision, a heavenly
figure painted upon the sky.</p>

<p class='c012'>On Sunday afternoons in summer, Martha
sat by the window of her chamber, a low-storied
little room, which looked into the
side yard and the great branches of an elm-tree.
She never sat in the old wooden
rocking-chair except on Sundays like this;
it belonged to the day of rest and to happy
meditation. She wore her plain black dress
and a clean white apron, and held in her lap
a little wooden box, with a brass ring on
top for a handle. She was past sixty years
of age and looked even older, but there was
the same look on her face that it had sometimes
worn in girlhood. She was the same
Martha; her hands were old-looking and
work-worn, but her face still shone. It
seemed like yesterday that Helena Vernon
had gone away, and it was more than forty
years.</p>

<p class='c011'>War and peace had brought their changes
and great anxieties, the face of the earth
was furrowed by floods and fire, the faces of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>mistress and maid were furrowed by smiles
and tears, and in the shy the stars shone on
as if nothing had happened. The village of
Ashford added a few pages to its unexciting
history, the minister preached, the people
listened; now and then a funeral crept along
the street, and now and then the bright face
of a little child rose above the horizon of a
family pew. Miss Harriet Pyne lived on in
the large white house, which gained more
and more distinction because it suffered no
changes, save successive repaintings and a
new railing about its stately roof. Miss
Harriet herself had moved far beyond the
uncertainties of an anxious youth. She had
long ago made all her decisions, and settled
all necessary questions; her scheme of life
was as faultless as the miniature landscape
of a Japanese garden, and as easily kept
in order. The only important change she
would ever be capable of making was the
final change to another and a better world;
and for that nature itself would gently provide,
and her own innocent life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Hardly any great social event had ruffled
the easy current of life since Helena Vernon’s
marriage. To this Miss Pyne had
gone, stately in appearance and carrying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>gifts of some old family silver which bore
the Vernon crest, but not without some protest
in her heart against the uncertainties
of married life. Helena was so equal to a
happy independence and even to the assistance
of other lives grown strangely dependent
upon her quick sympathies and instinctive
decisions, that it was hard to let her
sink her personality in the affairs of another.
Yet a brilliant English match was not without
its attractions to an old-fashioned gentlewoman
like Miss Pyne, and Helena herself
was amazingly happy; one day there had
come a letter to Ashford, in which her
very heart seemed to beat with love and
self-forgetfulness, to tell cousin Harriet of
such new happiness and high hope. “Tell
Martha all that I say about my dear Jack,”
wrote the eager girl; “please show my
letter to Martha, and tell her that I shall
come home next summer and bring the
handsomest and best man in the world to
Ashford. I have told him all about the
dear house and the dear garden; there
never was such a lad to reach for cherries
with his six-foot-two.” Miss Pyne, wondering
a little, gave the letter to Martha, who
took it deliberately and as if she wondered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>too, and went away to read it slowly by
herself. Martha cried over it, and felt a
strange sense of loss and pain; it hurt her
heart a little to read about the cherry-picking.
Her idol seemed to be less her own
since she had become the idol of a stranger.
She never had taken such a letter in her
hands before, but love at last prevailed,
since Miss Helena was happy, and she
kissed the last page where her name was
written, feeling overbold, and laid the envelope
on Miss Pyne’s secretary without a
word.</p>

<p class='c011'>The most generous love cannot but long
for reassurance, and Martha had the joy of
being remembered. She was not forgotten
when the day of the wedding drew near,
but she never knew that Miss Helena had
asked if cousin Harriet would not bring
Martha to town; she should like to have
Martha there to see her married. “She
would help about the flowers,” wrote the
happy girl; “I know she will like to come,
and I’ll ask mamma to plan to have some
one take her all about Boston and make her
have a pleasant time after the hurry of the
great day is over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Cousin Harriet thought it was very kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>and exactly like Helena, but Martha would
be out of her element; it was most imprudent
and girlish to have thought of such
a thing. Helena’s mother would be far
from wishing for any unnecessary guest just
then, in the busiest part of her household,
and it was best not to speak of the invitation.
Some day Martha should go to Boston
if she did well, but not now. Helena
did not forget to ask if Martha had come,
and was astonished by the indifference of
the answer. It was the first thing which
reminded her that she was not a fairy
princess having everything her own way in
that last day before the wedding. She
knew that Martha would have loved to be
near, for she could not help understanding
in that moment of her own happiness the
love that was hidden in another heart.
Next day this happy young princess, the
bride, cut a piece of a great cake and put
it into a pretty box that had held one of her
wedding presents. With eager voices calling
her, and all her friends about her, and
her mother’s face growing more and more
wistful at the thought of parting, she still
lingered and ran to take one or two trifles
from her dressing-table, a little mirror and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>some tiny scissors that Martha would remember,
and one of the pretty handkerchiefs
marked with her maiden name.
These she put in the box too; it was half
a girlish freak and fancy, but she could
not help trying to share her happiness, and
Martha’s life was so plain and dull. She
whispered a message, and put the little
package into cousin Harriet’s hand for
Martha as she said good-by. She was very
fond of cousin Harriet. She smiled with
a gleam of her old fun; Martha’s puzzled
look and tall awkward figure seemed to stand
suddenly before her eyes, as she promised
to come again to Ashford. Impatient voices
called to Helena, her lover was at the door,
and she hurried away, leaving her old home
and her girlhood gladly. If she had only
known it, as she kissed cousin Harriet good-by,
they were never going to see each other
again until they were old women. The first
step that she took out of her father’s house
that day, married, and full of hope and joy,
was a step that led her away from the green
elms of Boston Common and away from her
own country and those she loved best, to
a brilliant, much-varied foreign life, and to
nearly all the sorrows and nearly all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>joys that the heart of one woman could hold
or know.</p>

<p class='c011'>On Sunday afternoons Martha used to sit
by the window in Ashford and hold the
wooden box which a favorite young brother,
who afterward died at sea, had made for her,
and she used to take out of it the pretty little
box with a gilded cover that had held the
piece of wedding-cake, and the small scissors,
and the blurred bit of a mirror in its silver
case; as for the handkerchief with the
narrow lace edge, once in two or three years
she sprinkled it as if it were a flower, and
spread it out in the sun on the old bleaching-green,
and sat near by in the shrubbery
to watch lest some bold robin or cherry-bird
should seize it and fly away.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Miss Harriet Pyne was often congratulated
upon the good fortune of having such
a helper and friend as Martha. As time
went on this tall, gaunt woman, always thin,
always slow, gained a dignity of behavior
and simple affectionateness of look which
suited the charm and dignity of the ancient
house. She was unconsciously beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>like a saint, like the picturesqueness of a
lonely tree which lives to shelter unnumbered
lives and to stand quietly in its place.
There was such rustic homeliness and constancy
belonging to her, such beautiful
powers of apprehension, such reticence, such
gentleness for those who were troubled or
sick; all these gifts and graces Martha hid
in her heart. She never joined the church
because she thought she was not good
enough, but life was such a passion and
happiness of service that it was impossible
not to be devout, and she was always in her
humble place on Sundays, in the back pew
next the door. She had been educated by a
remembrance; Helena’s young eyes forever
looked at her reassuringly from a gay girlish
face. Helena’s sweet patience in teaching
her own awkwardness could never be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I owe everything to Miss Helena,” said
Martha, half aloud, as she sat alone by the
window; she had said it to herself a thousand
times. When she looked in the little
keepsake mirror she always hoped to see
some faint reflection of Helena Vernon, but
there was only her own brown old New England
face to look back at her wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Miss Pyne went less and less often to pay
visits to her friends in Boston; there were
very few friends left to come to Ashford and
make long visits in the summer, and life
grew more and more monotonous. Now and
then there came news from across the sea
and messages of remembrance, letters that
were closely written on thin sheets of paper,
and that spoke of lords and ladies, of great
journeys, of the death of little children and
the proud successes of boys at school, of the
wedding of Helena Dysart’s only daughter;
but even that had happened years ago.
These things seemed far away and vague, as
if they belonged to a story and not to life
itself; the true links with the past were
quite different. There was the unvarying
flock of ground-sparrows that Helena had
begun to feed; every morning Martha scattered
crumbs for them from the side doorsteps
while Miss Pyne watched from the
dining-room window, and they were counted
and cherished year by year.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Pyne herself had many fixed habits,
but little ideality or imagination, and so at
last it was Martha who took thought for her
mistress, and gave freedom to her own good
taste. After a while, without any one’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>observing the change, the every-day ways of
doing things in the house came to be the
stately ways that had once belonged only to
the entertainment of guests. Happily both
mistress and maid seized all possible chances
for hospitality, yet Miss Harriet nearly always
sat alone at her exquisitely served table
with its fresh flowers, and the beautiful old
china which Martha handled so lovingly that
there was no good excuse for keeping it hidden
on closet shelves. Every year when the
old cherry-trees were in fruit, Martha carried
the round white old English dish with
a fretwork edge, full of pointed green leaves
and scarlet cherries, to the minister, and his
wife never quite understood why every year
he blushed and looked so conscious of the
pleasure, and thanked Martha as if he had
received a very particular attention. There
was no pretty suggestion toward the pursuit
of the fine art of housekeeping in Martha’s
limited acquaintance with newspapers that
she did not adopt; there was no refined old
custom of the Pyne housekeeping that she
consented to let go. And every day, as she
had promised, she thought of Miss Helena,—oh,
many times in every day: whether
this thing would please her, or that be likely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>to fall in with her fancy or ideas of fitness.
As far as was possible the rare news that
reached Ashford through an occasional letter
or the talk of guests was made part of
Martha’s own life, the history of her own
heart. A worn old geography often stood
open at the map of Europe on the light-stand
in her room, and a little old-fashioned
gilt button, set with a bit of glass like a
ruby, that had broken and fallen from the
trimming of one of Helena’s dresses, was
used to mark the city of her dwelling-place.
In the changes of a diplomatic life Martha
followed her lady all about the map. Sometimes
the button was at Paris, and sometimes
at Madrid; once, to her great anxiety, it
remained long at St. Petersburg. For such
a slow scholar Martha was not unlearned at
last, since everything about life in these foreign
towns was of interest to her faithful
heart. She satisfied her own mind as she
threw crumbs to the tame sparrows; it was
all part of the same thing and for the same
affectionate reasons.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>V.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>One Sunday afternoon in early summer
Miss Harriet Pyne came hurrying along the
entry that led to Martha’s room and called
two or three times before its inhabitant could
reach the door. Miss Harriet looked unusually
cheerful and excited, and she held something
in her hand. “Where are you, Martha?”
she called again. “Come quick, I
have something to tell you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here I am, Miss Pyne,” said Martha,
who had only stopped to put her precious box
in the drawer, and to shut the geography.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who do you think is coming this very
night at half past six? We must have everything
as nice as we can; I must see Hannah
at once. Do you remember my cousin
Helena who has lived abroad so long? Miss
Helena Vernon,—the Honorable Mrs. Dysart,
she is now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I remember her,” answered Martha,
turning a little pale.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I knew that she was in this country, and
I had written to ask her to come for a long
visit,” continued Miss Harriet, who did not
often explain things, even to Martha, though
she was always conscientious about the kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>messages that were sent back by grateful
guests. “She telegraphs that she means to
anticipate her visit by a few days and come
to me at once. The heat is beginning in
town, I suppose. I daresay, having been a
foreigner so long, she does not mind traveling
on Sunday. Do you think Hannah will
be prepared? We must have tea a little
later.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, Miss Harriet,” said Martha. She
wondered that she could speak as usual,
there was such a ringing in her ears. “I shall
have time to pick some fresh strawberries;
Miss Helena is so fond of our strawberries.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I had forgotten,” said Miss Pyne,
a little puzzled by something quite unusual
in Martha’s face. “We must expect to find
Mrs. Dysart a good deal changed, Martha; it
is a great many years since she was here; I
have not seen her since her wedding, and she
has had a great deal of trouble, poor girl.
You had better open the parlor chamber,
and make it ready before you go down.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is all ready,” said Martha. “I can
carry some of those little sweet-brier roses
upstairs before she comes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, you are always thoughtful,” said
Miss Pyne, with unwonted feeling.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>Martha did not answer. She glanced at the
telegram wistfully. She had never really
suspected before that Miss Pyne knew nothing
of the love that had been in her heart
all these years; it was half a pain and half
a golden joy to keep such a secret; she
could hardly bear this moment of surprise.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently the news gave wings to her
willing feet. When Hannah, the cook, who
never had known Miss Helena, went to the
parlor an hour later on some errand to her
old mistress, she discovered that this stranger
guest must be a very important person. She
had never seen the tea-table look exactly as
it did that night, and in the parlor itself
there were fresh blossoming boughs in the
old East India jars, and lilies in the paneled
hall, and flowers everywhere, as if there
were some high festivity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Pyne sat by the window watching,
in her best dress, looking stately and calm;
she seldom went out now, and it was almost
time for the carriage. Martha was just
coming in from the garden with the strawberries,
and with more flowers in her apron.
It was a bright cool evening in June, the
golden robins sang in the elms, and the sun
was going down behind the apple-trees at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>the foot of the garden. The beautiful old
house stood wide open to the long-expected
guest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think that I shall go down to the gate,”
said Miss Pyne, looking at Martha for approval,
and Martha nodded and they went
together slowly down the broad front walk.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a sound of horses and wheels
on the roadside turf: Martha could not see
at first; she stood back inside the gate behind
the white lilac-bushes as the carriage came.
Miss Pyne was there; she was holding out
both arms and taking a tired, bent little
figure in black to her heart. “Oh, my
Miss Helena is an old woman like me!”
and Martha gave a pitiful sob; she had
never dreamed it would be like this; this
was the one thing she could not bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are you, Martha?” called Miss
Pyne. “Martha will bring these in; you
have not forgotten my good Martha, Helena?”
Then Mrs. Dysart looked up and
smiled just as she used to smile in the old
days. The young eyes were there still in
the changed face, and Miss Helena had come.</p>

<p class='c012'>That night Martha waited in her lady’s
room just as she used, humble and silent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>and went through with the old unforgotten
loving services. The long years seemed like
days. At last she lingered a moment trying
to think of something else that might
be done, then she was going silently away,
but Helena called her back. She suddenly
knew the whole story and could hardly speak.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my dear Martha!” she cried, “won’t
you kiss me good-night? Oh, Martha, have
you remembered like this, all these long
years!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE GUESTS OF MRS. TIMMS.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>I.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Persis Flagg stood in her front
doorway taking leave of Miss Cynthia Pickett,
who had been making a long call. They
were not intimate friends. Miss Pickett always
came formally to the front door and
rang when she paid her visits, but, the week
before, they had met at the county conference,
and happened to be sent to the same
house for entertainment, and so had deepened
and renewed the pleasures of acquaintance.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was an afternoon in early June; the
syringa-bushes were tall and green on each
side of the stone doorsteps, and were covered
with their lovely white and golden
flowers. Miss Pickett broke off the nearest
twig, and held it before her prim face as
she talked. She had a pretty childlike
smile that came and went suddenly, but her
face was not one that bore the marks of
many pleasures. Mrs. Flagg was a tall,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>commanding sort of person, with an air of
satisfaction and authority.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes, gather all you want,” she said
stiffly, as Miss Pickett took the syringa
without having asked beforehand; but she
had an amiable expression, and just now her
large countenance was lighted up by pleasant
anticipation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We can tell early what sort of a day
it’s goin’ to be,” she said eagerly. “There
ain’t a cloud in the sky now. I’ll stop for
you as I come along, or if there should be
anything unforeseen to detain me, I’ll send
you word. I don’t expect you’d want to
go if it wa’n’t so that I could?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh my sakes, no!” answered Miss Pickett
discreetly, with a timid flush. “You
feel certain that Mis’ Timms won’t be put
out? I shouldn’t feel free to go unless I
went ’long o’ you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, nothin’ could be plainer than her
words,” said Mrs. Flagg in a tone of reproval.
“You saw how she urged me, an’
had over all that talk about how we used to
see each other often when we both lived to
Longport, and told how she’d been thinkin’
of writin’, and askin’ if it wa’n’t so I should
be able to come over and stop three or four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>days as soon as settled weather come, because
she couldn’t make no fire in her best
chamber on account of the chimbley smokin’
if the wind wa’n’t just right. You see how
she felt toward me, kissin’ of me comin’ and
goin’? Why, she even asked me who I
employed to do over my bonnet, Miss Pickett,
just as interested as if she was a sister;
an’ she remarked she should look for us any
pleasant day after we all got home, an’ were
settled after the conference.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Pickett smiled, but did not speak,
as if she expected more arguments still.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ she seemed just about as much
gratified to meet with you again. She
seemed to desire to meet you again very
particular,” continued Mrs. Flagg. “She
really urged us to come together an’ have a
real good day talkin’ over old times—there,
don’t le’ ’s go all over it again! I’ve always
heard she’d made that old house of
her aunt Bascoms’ where she lives look real
handsome. I once heard her best parlor
carpet described as being an elegant carpet,
different from any there was round here.
Why, nobody couldn’t be more cordial,
Miss Pickett; you ain’t goin’ to give out
just at the last?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“Oh, no!” answered the visitor hastily;
“no, ’m! I want to go full as much as you
do, Mis’ Flagg, but you see I never was so
well acquainted with Mis’ Cap’n Timms,
an’ I always seem to dread putting myself
for’ard. She certain was very urgent, an’
she said plain enough to come any day next
week, an’ here ’tis Wednesday, though of
course she wouldn’t look for us either Monday
or Tuesday. ’Twill be a real pleasant
occasion, an’ now we’ve been to the conference
it don’t seem near so much effort to
start.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I don’t think nothin’ of it,” said
Mrs. Flagg proudly. “We shall have a
grand good time, goin’ together an’ all, I
feel sure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Pickett still played with her syringa
flower, tapping her thin cheek, and twirling
the stem with her fingers. She looked as if
she were going to say something more, but
after a moment’s hesitation she turned away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-afternoon, Mis’ Flagg,” she said
formally, looking up with a quick little
smile; “I enjoyed my call; I hope I ain’t
kep’ you too late; I don’t know but what
it’s ’most tea-time. Well, I shall look for
you in the mornin’.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>“Good-afternoon, Miss Pickett; I’m glad
I was in when you came. Call again, won’t
you?” said Mrs. Flagg. “Yes; you may
expect me in good season,” and so they
parted. Miss Pickett went out at the neat
clicking gate in the white fence, and Mrs.
Flagg a moment later looked out of her sitting-room
window to see if the gate were
latched, and felt the least bit disappointed
to find that it was. She sometimes went
out after the departure of a guest, and fastened
the gate herself with a loud, rebuking
sound. Both of these Woodville women
lived alone, and were very precise in their
way of doing things.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>II.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The next morning dawned clear and
bright, and Miss Pickett rose even earlier
than usual. She found it most difficult to
decide which of her dresses would be best to
wear. Summer was still so young that the
day had all the freshness of spring, but
when the two friends walked away together
along the shady street, with a chorus of
golden robins singing high overhead in the
elms, Miss Pickett decided that she had
made a wise choice of her second-best black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>silk gown, which she had just turned again
and freshened. It was neither too warm
for the season nor too cool, nor did it look
overdressed. She wore her large cameo pin,
and this, with a long watch-chain, gave an
air of proper mural decoration. She was a
straight, flat little person, as if, when not in
use, she kept herself, silk dress and all, between
the leaves of a book. She carried a
noticeable parasol with a fringe, and a small
shawl, with a pretty border, neatly folded
over her left arm. Mrs. Flagg always
dressed in black cashmere, and looked, to
hasty observers, much the same one day as
another; but her companion recognized the
fact that this was the best black cashmere
of all, and for a moment quailed at the
thought that Mrs. Flagg was paying such
extreme deference to their prospective hostess.
The visit turned for a moment into
an unexpectedly solemn formality, and pleasure
seemed to wane before Cynthia Pickett’s
eyes, yet with great courage she never
slackened a single step. Mrs. Flagg carried
a somewhat worn black leather handbag,
which Miss Pickett regretted; it did
not give the visit that casual and unpremeditated
air which she felt to be more elegant.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>“Sha’n’t I carry your bag for you?” she
asked timidly. Mrs. Flagg was the older
and more important person.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, dear me, no,” answered Mrs. Flagg.
“My pocket’s so remote, in case I should
desire to sneeze or anything, that I thought
’twould be convenient for carrying my handkerchief
and pocket-book; an’ then I just
tucked in a couple o’ glasses o’ my crabapple
jelly for Mis’ Timms. She used to
be a great hand for preserves of every sort,
an’ I thought ’twould be a kind of an attention,
an’ give rise to conversation. I
know she used to make excellent drop-cakes
when we was both residin’ to Longport;
folks used to say she never would give the
right receipt, but if I get a real good chance,
I mean to ask her. Or why can’t you, if I
start talkin’ about receipts—why can’t you
say, sort of innocent, that I have always
spoken frequently of her drop-cakes, an’
ask for the rule? She would be very sensible
to the compliment, and could pass it off
if she didn’t feel to indulge us. There, I
do so wish you would!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, ’m,” said Miss Pickett doubtfully;
“I’ll try to make the opportunity. I’m
very partial to drop-cakes. Was they flour
or rye, Mis’ Flagg?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“They was flour, dear,” replied Mrs.
Flagg approvingly; “crisp an’ light as any
you ever see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish I had thought to carry somethin’
to make it pleasant,” said Miss Pickett,
after they had walked a little farther; “but
there, I don’t know’s ’twould look just
right, this first visit, to offer anything to
such a person as Mis’ Timms. In case I
ever go over to Baxter again I won’t forget
to make her some little present, as nice as
I’ve got. ’Twas certain very polite of her
to urge me to come with you. I did feel
very doubtful at first. I didn’t know but
she thought it behooved her, because I was
in your company at the conference, and she
wanted to save my feelin’s, and yet expected
I would decline. I never was well acquainted
with her; our folks wasn’t well off
when I first knew her; ’twas before uncle
Cap’n Dyer passed away an’ remembered
mother an’ me in his will. We couldn’t
make no han’some companies in them days,
so we didn’t go to none, an’ kep’ to ourselves;
but in my grandmother’s time, mother
always said, the families was very
friendly. I shouldn’t feel like goin’ over
to pass the day with Mis’ Timms if I didn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>mean to ask her to return the visit. Some
don’t think o’ these things, but mother was
very set about not bein’ done for when she
couldn’t make no return.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘When it rains porridge hold up your
dish,’” said Mrs. Flagg; but Miss Pickett
made no response beyond a feeble “Yes, ’m,”
which somehow got caught in her pale-green
bonnet-strings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, ’tain’t no use to fuss too much
over all them things,” proclaimed Mrs.
Flagg, walking along at a good pace with
a fine sway of her skirts, and carrying her
head high. “Folks walks right by an’ forgits
all about you; folks can’t always be
going through with just so much. You’d
had a good deal better time, you an’ your
ma, if you’d been freer in your ways; now
don’t you s’pose you would? ’Tain’t what
you give folks to eat so much as ’tis makin’
’em feel welcome. Now, there’s Mis’
Timms; when we was to Longport she was
dreadful methodical. She wouldn’t let
Cap’n Timms fetch nobody home to dinner
without lettin’ of her know, same’s other
cap’ns’ wives had to submit to. I was thinkin’,
when she was so cordial over to Danby,
how she’d softened with time. Years do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>learn folks somethin’! She did seem very
pleasant an’ desirous. There, I am so glad
we got started; if she’d gone an’ got up a
real good dinner to-day, an’ then not had us
come till to-morrow, ’twould have been real
too bad. Where anybody lives alone such
a thing is very tryin’.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, so ’tis!” said Miss Pickett.
“There, I’d like to tell you what I went
through with year before last. They come
an’ asked me one Saturday night to entertain
the minister, that time we was having
candidates”—</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess we’d better step along faster,”
said Mrs. Flagg suddenly. “Why, Miss
Pickett, there’s the stage comin’ now! It’s
dreadful prompt, seems to me. Quick!
there’s folks awaitin’, an’ I sha’n’t get to
Baxter in no state to visit Mis’ Cap’n Timms
if I have to ride all the way there backward!”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>III.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The stage was not full inside. The group
before the store proved to be made up of
spectators, except one man, who climbed at
once to a vacant seat by the driver. Inside
there was only one person, after two passengers
got out, and she preferred to sit with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>her back to the horses, so that Mrs. Flagg
and Miss Pickett settled themselves comfortably
in the coveted corners of the back
seat. At first they took no notice of their
companion, and spoke to each other in low
tones, but presently something attracted the
attention of all three and engaged them in
conversation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never was over this road before,” said
the stranger. “I s’pose you ladies are well
acquainted all along.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We have often traveled it in past years.
We was over this part of it last week goin’
and comin’ from the county conference,”
said Mrs. Flagg in a dignified manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What persuasion?” inquired the fellow-traveler,
with interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Orthodox,” said Miss Pickett quickly,
before Mrs. Flagg could speak. “It was a
very interestin’ occasion; this other lady an
me stayed through all the meetin’s.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I ain’t Orthodox,” announced the
stranger, waiving any interest in personalities.
“I was brought up amongst the Freewill
Baptists.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’re well acquainted with several of
that denomination in our place,” said Mrs.
Flagg, not without an air of patronage.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>“They’ve never built ’em no church; there
ain’t but a scattered few.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They prevail where I come from,” said
the traveler. “I’m goin’ now to visit with
a Freewill lady. We was to a conference
together once, same ’s you an’ your friend,
but ’twas a state conference. She asked
me to come some time an’ make her a good
visit, and I’m on my way now. I didn’t
seem to have nothin’ to keep me to home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’re all goin’ visitin’ to-day, ain’t
we?” said Mrs. Flagg sociably; but no one
carried on the conversation.</p>

<p class='c011'>The day was growing very warm; there
was dust in the sandy road, but the fields of
grass and young growing crops looked fresh
and fair. There was a light haze over the
hills, and birds were thick in the air.
When the stage-horses stopped to walk, you
could hear the crows caw, and the bobolinks
singing, in the meadows. All the farmers
were busy in their fields.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It don’t seem but little ways to Baxter,
does it?” said Miss Pickett, after a while.
“I felt we should pass a good deal o’ time
on the road, but we must be pretty near
half-way there a’ready.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, more ’n half!” exclaimed Mrs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Flagg. “Yes; there’s Beckett’s Corner
right ahead, an the old Beckett house. I
haven’t been on this part of the road for so
long that I feel kind of strange. I used to
visit over here when I was a girl. There’s
a nephew’s widow owns the place now. Old
Miss Susan Beckett willed it to him, an’ he
died; but she resides there an’ carries on
the farm, an unusual smart woman, everybody
says. Ain’t it pleasant here, right out
among the farms!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mis’ Beckett’s place, did you observe?”
said the stranger, leaning forward to listen
to what her companions said. “I expect
that’s where I’m goin’—Mis’ Ezra Beckett’s?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s the one,” said Miss Pickett and
Mrs. Flagg together, and they both looked
out eagerly as the coach drew up to the front
door of a large old yellow house that stood
close upon the green turf of the roadside.</p>

<p class='c011'>The passenger looked pleased and eager,
and made haste to leave the stage with her
many bundles and bags. While she stood
impatiently tapping at the brass knocker,
the stage-driver landed a large trunk, and
dragged it toward the door across the grass.
Just then a busy-looking middle-aged woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>made her appearance, with floury hands
and a look as if she were prepared to be
somewhat on the defensive.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, how do you do, Mis’ Beckett?”
exclaimed the guest. “Well, here I be at
last. I didn’t know ’s you thought I was
ever comin’. Why, I do declare, I believe
you don’t recognize me, Mis’ Beckett.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe I don’t,” said the self-possessed
hostess. “Ain’t you made some mistake,
ma’am?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, don’t you recollect we was together
that time to the state conference, an’
you said you should be pleased to have me
come an’ make you a visit some time, an’ I
said I would certain. There, I expect I
look more natural to you now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Beckett appeared to be making the
best possible effort, and gave a bewildered
glance, first at her unexpected visitor, and
then at the trunk. The stage-driver, who
watched this encounter with evident delight,
turned away with reluctance. “I can’t wait
all day to see how they settle it,” he said,
and mounted briskly to the box, and the
stage rolled on.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He might have waited just a minute to
see,” said Miss Pickett indignantly, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Mrs. Flagg’s head and shoulders were already
far out of the stage window—the
house was on her side. “She ain’t got in
yet,” she told Miss Pickett triumphantly.
“I could see ’em quite a spell. With that
trunk, too! I do declare, how inconsiderate
some folks is!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Twas pushin’ an acquaintance most
too far, wa’n’t it?” agreed Miss Pickett.
“There,’twill be somethin’ laughable to
tell Mis’ Timms. I never see anything
more divertin’. I shall kind of pity that
woman if we have to stop an’ git her as we
go back this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, don’t let’s forgit to watch for her,”
exclaimed Mrs. Flagg, beginning to brush
off the dust of travel. “There, I feel an
excellent appetite, don’t you? And we ain’t
got more ’n three or four miles to go, if we
have that. I wonder what Mis’ Timms is
likely to give us for dinner; she spoke of
makin’ a good many chicken-pies, an’ I
happened to remark how partial I was to
’em. She felt above most of the things we
had provided for us over to the conference.
I know she was always counted the best o’
cooks when I knew her so well to Longport.
Now, don’t you forget, if there’s a suitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>opportunity, to inquire about the drop-cakes;”
and Miss Pickett, a little less
doubtful than before, renewed her promise.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>IV.</h3>

<p class='c010'>“My gracious, won’t Mis’ Timms be
pleased to see us! It’s just exactly the day
to have company. And ain’t Baxter a sweet
pretty place?” said Mrs. Flagg, as they
walked up the main street. “Cynthy Pickett,
now ain’t you proper glad you come?
I felt sort o’ calm about it part o’ the time
yesterday, but I ain’t felt so like a girl for
a good while. I do believe I’m goin’ to
have a splendid time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Pickett glowed with equal pleasure
as she paced along. She was less expansive
and enthusiastic than her companion, but
now that they were fairly in Baxter, she lent
herself generously to the occasion. The
social distinction of going away to spend a
day in company with Mrs. Flagg was by no
means small. She arranged the folds of her
shawl more carefully over her arm so as to
show the pretty palm-leaf border, and then
looked up with great approval to the row of
great maples that shaded the broad sidewalk.
“I wonder if we can’t contrive to make time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>to go an’ see old Miss Nancy Fell?” she
ventured to ask Mrs. Flagg. “There ain’t
a great deal o’ time before the stage goes
at four o’clock; ’twill pass quickly, but I
should hate to have her feel hurt. If she
was one we had visited often at home, I
shouldn’t care so much, but such folks feel
any little slight. She was a member of our
church; I think a good deal of that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I hardly know what to say,” faltered
Mrs. Flagg coldly. “We might just
look in a minute; I shouldn’t want her to
feel hurt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was one that always did her part,
too,” said Miss Pickett, more boldly. “Mr.
Cronin used to say that she was more generous
with her little than many was with
their much. If she hadn’t lived in a poor
part of the town, and so been occupied with
a different kind of people from us, ’twould
have made a difference. They say she’s got
a comfortable little home over here, an’
keeps house for a nephew. You know she
was to our meeting one Sunday last winter,
and ’peared dreadful glad to get back; folks
seemed glad to see her, too. I don’t know
as you were out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She always wore a friendly look,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Mrs. Flagg indulgently. “There, now,
there’s Mis’ Timms’s residence; it’s handsome,
ain’t it, with them big spruce-trees?
I expect she may be at the window now, an’
see us as we come along. Is my bonnet on
straight, an’ everything? The blinds looks
open in the room this way; I guess she’s to
home fast enough.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The friends quickened their steps, and
with shining eyes and beating hearts hastened
forward. The slightest mists of uncertainty
were now cleared away; they gazed
at the house with deepest pleasure; the visit
was about to begin.</p>

<p class='c011'>They opened the front gate and went up
the short walk, noticing the pretty herringbone
pattern of the bricks, and as they stood
on the high steps Cynthia Pickett wondered
whether she ought not to have worn her best
dress, even though there was lace at the neck
and sleeves, and she usually kept it for the
most formal of tea-parties and exceptional
parish festivals. In her heart she commended
Mrs. Flagg for that familiarity with
the ways of a wider social world which had
led her to wear the very best among her
black cashmeres.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s a good while coming to the door,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>whispered Mrs. Flagg presently. “Either
she didn’t see us, or else she’s slipped upstairs
to make some change, an’ is just goin’
to let us ring again. I’ve done it myself
sometimes. I’m glad we come right over
after her urgin’ us so; it seems more cordial
than to keep her expectin’ us. I expect
she’ll urge us terribly to remain with her
over night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I ain’t prepared,” began Miss Pickett,
but she looked pleased. At that moment
there was a slow withdrawal of the
bolt inside, and a key was turned, the front
door opened, and Mrs. Timms stood before
them with a smile. Nobody stopped to think
at that moment what kind of smile it was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, if it ain’t Mis’ Flagg,” she exclaimed
politely, “an’ Miss Pickett too! I
am surprised!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The front entry behind her looked well
furnished, but not exactly hospitable; the
stairs with their brass rods looked so clean
and bright that it did not seem as if anybody
had ever gone up or come down. A
cat came purring out, but Mrs. Timms
pushed her back with a determined foot, and
hastily closed the sitting-room door. Then
Miss Pickett let Mrs. Flagg precede her, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>was becoming, and they went into a darkened
parlor, and found their way to some
chairs, and seated themselves solemnly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis a beautiful day, ain’t it?” said
Mrs. Flagg, speaking first. “I don’t know ’s
I ever enjoyed the ride more. We’ve been
having a good deal of rain since we saw you
at the conference, and the country looks
beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you leave Woodville this morning?
I thought I hadn’t heard you was in town,”
replied Mrs. Timms formally. She was
seated just a little too far away to make
things seem exactly pleasant. The darkness
of the best room seemed to retreat somewhat,
and Miss Pickett looked over by the door,
where there was a pale gleam from the sidelights
in the hall, to try to see the pattern
of the carpet; but her effort failed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, ’m,” replied Mrs. Flagg to the
question. “We left Woodville about half
past eight, but it is quite a ways from where
we live to where you take the stage. The
stage does come slow, but you don’t seem to
mind it such a beautiful day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, you must have come right to see
me first!” said Mrs. Timms, warming a
little as the visit went on. “I hope you’re
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>going to make some stop in town. I’m sure
it was very polite of you to come right an’
see me; well, it’s very pleasant, I declare.
I wish you’d been in Baxter last Sabbath;
our minister did give us an elegant sermon
on faith an’ works. He spoke of the conference,
and gave his views on some o’ the
questions that came up, at Friday evenin’
meetin’; but I felt tired after getting home,
an’ so I wasn’t out. We feel very much
favored to have such a man amon’st us.
He’s building up the parish very considerable.
I understand the pew-rents come to
thirty-six dollars more this quarter than
they did last.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We also feel grateful in Woodville for
our pastor’s efforts,” said Miss Pickett; but
Mrs. Timms turned her head away sharply,
as if the speech had been untimely, and
trembling Miss Pickett had interrupted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They’re thinking here of raisin’ Mr.
Barlow’s salary another year,” the hostess
added; “a good many of the old parishioners
have died off, but every one feels to
do what they can. Is there much interest
among the young people in Woodville, Mis’
Flagg?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Considerable at this time, ma’am,” answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Mrs. Flagg, without enthusiasm, and
she listened with unusual silence to the subsequent
fluent remarks of Mrs. Timms.</p>

<p class='c011'>The parlor seemed to be undergoing the
slow processes of a winter dawn. After a
while the three women could begin to see
one another’s faces, which aided them somewhat
in carrying on a serious and impersonal
conversation. There were a good many subjects
to be touched upon, and Mrs. Timms
said everything that she should have said,
except to invite her visitors to walk upstairs
and take off their bonnets. Mrs. Flagg sat
her parlor-chair as if it were a throne, and
carried her banner of self-possession as high
as she knew how, but toward the end of the
call even she began to feel hurried.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Won’t you ladies take a glass of wine an’
a piece of cake after your ride?” inquired
Mrs. Timms, with an air of hospitality that
almost concealed the fact that neither cake
nor wine was anywhere to be seen; but the
ladies bowed and declined with particular
elegance. Altogether it was a visit of extreme
propriety on both sides, and Mrs.
Timms was very pressing in her invitation
that her guests should stay longer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, but we ought to be going,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>answered Mrs. Flagg, with a little show of
ostentation, and looking over her shoulder
to be sure that Miss Pickett had risen too.
“We’ve got some little ways to go,” she
added with dignity. “We should be pleased
to have you call an’ see us in case you have
occasion to come to Woodville,” and Miss
Pickett faintly seconded the invitation. It
was in her heart to add, “Come any day
next week,” but her courage did not rise so
high as to make the words audible. She
looked as if she were ready to cry; her usual
smile had burnt itself out into gray ashes;
there was a white, appealing look about her
mouth. As they emerged from the dim parlor
and stood at the open front door, the bright
June day, the golden-green trees, almost
blinded their eyes. Mrs. Timms was more
smiling and cordial than ever.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, I ought to have thought to offer
you fans; I am afraid you was warm after
walking,” she exclaimed, as if to leave no
stone of courtesy unturned. “I have so enjoyed
meeting you again, I wish it was so
you could stop longer. Why, Mis’ Flagg,
we haven’t said one word about old times
when we lived to Longport. I’ve had news
from there, too, since I saw you; my brother’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>daughter-in-law was here to pass the
Sabbath after I returned.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Flagg did not turn back to ask any
questions as she stepped stiffly away down
the brick walk. Miss Pickett followed her,
raising the fringed parasol; they both made
ceremonious little bows as they shut the high
white gate behind them. “Good-by,” said
Mrs. Timms finally, as she stood in the door
with her set smile; and as they departed she
came out and began to fasten up a rosebush
that climbed a narrow white ladder by
the steps.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, my goodness alive!” exclaimed Mrs.
Flagg, after they had gone some distance in
aggrieved silence, “if I haven’t gone and
forgotten my bag! I ain’t goin’ back, whatever
happens. I expect she’ll trip over it
in that dark room and break her neck!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I brought it; I noticed you’d forgotten
it,” said Miss Pickett timidly, as if she
hated to deprive her companion of even that
slight consolation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, I’ll tell you what we’d better do,”
said Mrs. Flagg gallantly; “we’ll go right
over an’ see poor old Miss Nancy Fell; ’twill
please her about to death. We can say we
felt like goin’ somewhere to-day, an’ ’twas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>a good many years since either one of us had
seen Baxter, so we come just for the ride,
an’ to make a few calls. She’ll like to hear
all about the conference; Miss Fell was
always one that took a real interest in religious
matters.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Pickett brightened, and they quickened
their step. It was nearly twelve o’clock,
they had breakfasted early, and now felt as
if they had eaten nothing since they were
grown up. An awful feeling of tiredness
and uncertainty settled down upon their once
buoyant spirits.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can forgive a person,” said Mrs. Flagg,
once, as if she were speaking to herself; “I
can forgive a person, but when I’m done
with ’em, I’m done.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>V.</h3>

<p class='c010'>“I do declare, ’twas like a scene in
Scriptur’ to see that poor good-hearted
Nancy Fell run down her walk to open the
gate for us!” said Mrs. Persis Flagg later
that afternoon, when she and Miss Pickett
were going home in the stage. Miss Pickett
nodded her head approvingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had a good sight better time with her
than I should have had at the other place,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>she said with fearless honesty. “If I’d
been Mis’ Cap’n Timms, I’d made some
apology or just passed us the compliment.
If it wa’n’t convenient, why couldn’t she
just tell us so after all her urgin’ and sayin’
how she should expect us?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought then she’d altered from what
she used to be,” said Mrs. Flagg. “She
seemed real sincere an’ open away from
home. If she wa’n’t prepared to-day,
’twas easy enough to say so; we was reasonable
folks, an’ should have gone away
with none but friendly feelin’s. We did
have a grand good time with Nancy. She
was as happy to see us as if we’d been
queens.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Twas a real nice little dinner,” said
Miss Pickett gratefully. “I thought I was
goin’ to faint away just before we got to the
house, and I didn’t know how I should hold
out if she undertook to do anything extra,
and keep us awaitin’; but there, she just
made us welcome, simple-hearted, to what
she had. I never tasted such dandelion
greens; an’ that nice little piece o’ pork
and new biscuit, why, they was just splendid.
She must have an excellent good cellar,
if ’tis such a small house. Her potatoes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>was truly remarkable for this time o’
year. I myself don’t deem it necessary to
cook potatoes when I’m goin’ to have dandelion
greens. Now, didn’t it put you in
mind of that verse in the Bible that says,
‘Better is a dinner of herbs where love is’?
An’ how desirous she’d been to see somebody
that could tell her some particulars
about the conference!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’ll enjoy tellin’ folks about our
comin’ over to see her. Yes, I’m glad we
went; ’twill be of advantage every way,
an’ our bein’ of the same church an’ all, to
Woodville. If Mis’ Timms hears of our
bein’ there, she’ll see we had reason, an’
knew of a place to go. Well, I needn’t
have brought this old bag!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Miss Pickett gave her companion a quick
resentful glance, which was followed by one
of triumph directed at the dust that was
collecting on the shoulders of the best black
cashmere; then she looked at the bag on the
front seat, and suddenly felt illuminated
with the suspicion that Mrs. Flagg had
secretly made preparations to pass the night
in Baxter. The bag looked plump, as if it
held much more than the pocket-book and
the jelly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Mrs. Flagg looked up with unusual humility.
“I did think about that jelly,” she said,
as if Miss Pickett had openly reproached
her. “I was afraid it might look as if I
was tryin’ to pay Nancy for her kindness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I don’t know,” said Cynthia; “I
guess she’d been pleased. She’d thought
you just brought her over a little present:
but I <a id='t220'></a>don’ know as ’twould been any good to
her after all; she’d thought so much of it,
comin’ from you, that she’d kep’ it till ’twas
all candied.” But Mrs. Flagg didn’t look
exactly pleased by this unexpected compliment,
and her fellow-traveler colored with
confusion and a sudden feeling that she had
shown undue forwardness.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently they remembered the Beckett
house, to their great relief, and, as they
approached, Mrs. Flagg reached over and
moved her handbag from the front seat
to make room for another passenger. But
nobody came out to stop the stage, and
they saw the unexpected guest sitting by
one of the front windows comfortably swaying
a palm-leaf fan, and rocking to and fro
in calm content. They shrank back into
their corners, and tried not to be seen.
Mrs. Flagg’s face grew very red.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>“She got in, didn’t she?” said Miss
Pickett, snipping her words angrily, as if
her lips were scissors. Then she heard a
call, and bent forward to see Mrs. Beckett
herself appear in the front doorway, very
smiling and eager to stop the stage.</p>

<p class='c011'>The driver was only too ready to stop
his horses. “Got a passenger for me to
carry back, ain’t ye?” said he facetiously.
“Them ’s the kind I like; carry both ways,
make somethin’ on a double trip,” and he
gave Mrs. Flagg and Miss Pickett a friendly
wink as he stepped down over the wheel.
Then he hurried toward the house, evidently
in a hurry to put the baggage on; but the
expected passenger still sat rocking and
fanning at the window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, sir; I ain’t got any passengers,”
exclaimed Mrs. Beckett, advancing a stop
or two to meet him, and speaking very loud
in her pleasant excitement. “This lady
that come this morning wants her large
trunk with her summer things that she left
to the depot in Woodville. She’s very desirous
to git into it, so don’t you go an’ forgit;
ain’t you got a book or somethin’, Mr.
Ma’sh? Don’t you forgit to make a note of
it; here’s her check, an’ we’ve kep’ the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>number in case you should mislay it or
anything. There’s things in the trunk she
needs; you know how you overlooked stoppin’
to the milliner’s for my bunnit last
week.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Other folks disremembers things as
well ’s me,” grumbled Mr. Marsh. He
turned to give the passengers another wink
more familiar than the first, but they wore
an offended air, and were looking the other
way. The horses had backed a few steps,
and the guest at the front window had
ceased the steady motion of her fan to
make them a handsome bow, and been
puzzled at the lofty manner of their acknowledgment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go ’long with your foolish jokes, John
Ma’sh!” Mrs. Beckett said cheerfully, as
she turned away. She was a comfortable,
hearty person, whose appearance adjusted
the beauties of hospitality. The driver
climbed to his seat, chuckling, and drove
away with the dust flying after the wheels.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, she’s a friendly sort of a woman,
that Mis’ Beckett,” said Mrs. Flagg unexpectedly,
after a few moments of silence,
when she and her friend had been unable to
look at each other. “I really ought to call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>over an’ see her some o’ these days, knowing
her husband’s folks as well as I used to, an’
visitin’ of ’em when I was a girl.” But
Miss Pickett made no answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I expect it was all for the best, that
woman’s comin’,” suggested Mrs. Flagg
again hopefully. “She looked like a willing
person who would take right hold. I
guess Mis’ Beckett knows what she’s about,
and must have had her reasons. Perhaps
she thought she’d chance it for a couple o’
weeks anyway, after the lady’d come so fur,
an’ bein’ one o’ her own denomination.
Hayin’-time’ll be here before we know it.
I think myself, gen’rally speakin’, ’tis just
as well to let anybody know you’re comin’.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Them seemed to be Mis’ Cap’n Timms’s
views,” said Miss Pickett in a low tone;
but the stage rattled a good deal, and Mrs.
Flagg looked up inquiringly, as if she had
not heard.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE TOWN POOR.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Mrs. William Trimble and Miss Rebecca
Wright were driving along Hampden
east road, one afternoon in early spring.
Their progress was slow. Mrs. Trimble’s
sorrel horse was old and stiff, and the wheels
were clogged by clay mud. The frost was
not yet out of the ground, although the snow
was nearly gone, except in a few places on
the north side of the woods, or where it had
drifted all winter against a length of fence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There must be a good deal o’ snow to
the nor’ard of us yet,” said weather-wise
Mrs. Trimble. “I feel it in the air; ’tis
more than the ground-damp. We ain’t
goin’ to have real nice weather till the up-country
snow ’s all gone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I heard say yesterday that there was
good sleddin’ yet, all up through Parsley,”
responded Miss Wright. “I shouldn’t like
to live in them northern places. My cousin
Ellen’s husband was a Parsley man, an’ he
was obliged, as you may have heard, to go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>up north to his father’s second wife’s funeral;
got back day before yesterday. ’Twas
about twenty-one miles, an’ they started on
wheels; but when they’d gone nine or ten
miles, they found ’twas no sort o’ use, an’
left their wagon an’ took a sleigh. The
man that owned it charged ’em four an’ six,
too. I shouldn’t have thought he would;
they told him they was goin’ to a funeral;
an’ they had their own buffaloes an’ everything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, I expect it’s a good deal harder
scratchin’, up that way; they have to git
money where they can; the farms is very
poor as you go north,” suggested Mrs.
Trimble kindly. “’Tain’t none too rich a
country where we be but I’ve always been
grateful I wa’n’t born up to Parsley.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old horse plodded along, and the sun,
coming out from the heavy spring clouds,
sent a sudden shine of light along the muddy
road. Sister Wright drew her large veil
forward over the high brim of her bonnet.
She was not used to driving, or to being
much in the open air; but Mrs. Trimble
was an active business woman, and looked
after her own affairs herself, in all weathers.
The late Mr. Trimble had left her a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>farm, but not much ready money, and it was
often said that she was better off in the end
than if he had lived. She regretted his loss
deeply, however; it was impossible for her
to speak of him, even to intimate friends,
without emotion, and nobody had ever
hinted that this emotion was insincere. She
was most warm-hearted and generous, and
in her limited way played the part of Lady
Bountiful in the town of Hampden.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, there’s where the Bray girls
lives, ain’t it?” she exclaimed, as, beyond
a thicket of witch-hazel and scrub-oak, they
came in sight of a weather-beaten, solitary
farmhouse. The barn was too far away for
thrift or comfort, and they could see long
lines of light between the shrunken boards
as they came nearer. The fields looked both
stony and sodden. Somehow, even Parsley
itself could be hardly more forlorn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes’m,” said Miss Wright, “that’s
where they live now, poor things. I know
the place, though I ain’t been up here for
years. You don’t suppose, Mis’ Trimble—I
ain’t seen the girls out to meetin’ all winter.
I’ve re’lly been covetin’”—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, yes, Rebecca, of course we could
stop,” answered Mrs. Trimble heartily.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“The exercises was over earlier ’n I expected,
an’ you’re goin’ to remain over
night long o’ me, you know. There won’t
be no tea till we git there, so we can’t be
late. I’m in the habit o’ sendin’ a basket
to the Bray girls when any o’ our folks is
comin’ this way, but I ain’t been to see ’em
since they moved up here. Why, it must
be a good deal over a year ago. I know ’t
was in the late winter they had to make the
move. ’Twas cruel hard, I must say, an’ if
I hadn’t been down with my pleurisy fever
I’d have stirred round an’ done somethin’
about it. There was a good deal o’ sickness
at the time, an’—well, ’twas kind o’ rushed
through, breakin’ of ’em up, an’ lots o’ folks
blamed the selec’<em>men</em>; but when ’twas done,
’twas done, an’ nobody took holt to undo
it. Ann an’ Mandy looked same ’s ever
when they come to meetin’, ’long in the summer,—kind
o’ wishful, perhaps. They’ve
always sent me word they was gittin’ on
pretty comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That would be their way,” said Rebecca
Wright. “They never was any hand to
complain, though Mandy’s less cheerful
than Ann. If Mandy’d been spared such
poor eyesight, an’ Ann hadn’t got her lame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>wrist that wa’n’t set right, they’d kep’ off
the town fast enough. They both shed tears
when they talked to me about havin’ to
break up, when I went to see ’em before I
went over to brother Asa’s. You see we
was brought up neighbors, an’ we went to
school together, the Brays an’ me. ’Twas
a special Providence brought us home this
road, I’ve been so covetin’ a chance to git
to see ’em. My lameness hampers me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m glad we come this way, myself,”
said Mrs. Trimble.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’d like to see just how they fare,” Miss
Rebecca Wright continued. “They give
their consent to goin’ on the town because
they knew they’d got to be dependent, an’
so they felt ’twould come easier for all than
for a few to help ’em. They acted real dignified
an’ right-minded, contrary to what
most do in such cases, but they was dreadful
anxious to see who would bid ’em off, town-meeting
day; they did so hope ’twould be
somebody right in the village. I just sat
down an’ cried good when I found Abel
Janes’s folks had got hold of ’em. They
always had the name of bein’ slack an’ poor-spirited,
an’ they did it just for what they
got out o’ the town. The selectmen this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>last year ain’t what we have had. I hope
they’ve been considerate about the Bray
girls.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should have be’n more considerate
about fetchin’ of you over,” apologized Mrs.
Trimble. “I’ve got my horse, an’ you’re
lame-footed; ’tis too far for you to come.
But time does slip away with busy folks, an’
I forgit a good deal I ought to remember.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s nobody more considerate than
you be,” protested Miss Rebecca Wright.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Trimble made no answer, but took
out her whip and gently touched the sorrel
horse, who walked considerably faster, but
did not think it worth while to trot. It was
a long, round-about way to the house, farther
down the road and up a lane.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I never had any opinion of the Bray
girls’ father, leavin’ ’em as he did,” said
Mrs. Trimble.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He was much praised in his time, though
there was always some said his early life
hadn’t been up to the mark,” explained her
companion. “He was a great favorite of
our then preacher, the Reverend Daniel
Longbrother. They did a good deal for the
parish, but they did it their own way.
Deacon Bray was one that did his part in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>the repairs without urging. You know ’twas
in his time the first repairs was made, when
they got out the old soundin’-board an’
them handsome square pews. It cost an
awful sight o’ money, too. They hadn’t
done payin’ up that debt when they set to
alter it again an’ git the walls frescoed.
My grandmother was one that always spoke
her mind right out, an’ she was dreadful
opposed to breakin’ up the square pews
where she’d always set. They was countin’
up what ’twould cost in parish meetin’, an’
she riz right up an’ said ’twouldn’t cost
nothin’ to let ’em stay, an’ there wa’n’t a
house carpenter left in the parish that could
do such nice work, an’ time would come
when the great-grandchildren would give
their eye-teeth to have the old meetin’-house
look just as it did then. But haul the inside
to pieces they would and did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There come to be a real fight over it,
didn’t there?” agreed Mrs. Trimble soothingly.
“Well, ’twa’n’t good taste. I remember
the old house well. I come here
as a child to visit a cousin o’ mother’s, an’
Mr. Trimble’s folks was neighbors, an’ we
was drawed to each other then, young ’s we
was. Mr. Trimble spoke of it many’s the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>time,—that first time he ever see me, in a
leghorn hat with a feather; ’twas one that
mother had, an’ pressed over.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When I think of them old sermons that
used to be preached in that old meetin’-house
of all, I’m glad it’s altered over, so ’s
not to remind folks,” said Miss Rebecca
Wright, after a suitable pause. “Them old
brimstone discourses, you know, Mis’ Trimble.
Preachers is far more reasonable,
nowadays. Why, I set an’ thought, last
Sabbath, as I listened, that if old Mr. Longbrother
an’ Deacon Bray could hear the difference
they’d crack the ground over ’em
like pole beans, an’ come right up ’long side
their headstones.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Trimble laughed heartily, and shook
the reins three or four times by way of emphasis.
“There ’s no gitting round you,”
she said, much pleased. “I should think
Deacon Bray would want to rise, any way,
if ’twas so he could, an’ knew how his poor
girls was farin’. A man ought to provide
for his folks he’s got to leave behind him,
specially if they’re women. To be sure,
they had their little home; but we’ve seen
how, with all their industrious ways, they
hadn’t means to keep it. I s’pose he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>thought he’d got time enough to lay by,
when he give so generous in collections; but
he didn’t lay by, an’ there they be. He
might have took lessons from the squirrels:
even them little wild creatur’s makes them
their winter hoards, an’ menfolks ought to
know enough if squirrels does. ‘Be just
before you are generous:’ that’s what was
always set for the B’s in the copy-books,
when I was to school, and it often runs
through my mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘As for man, his days are as grass,’—that
was for A; the two go well together,”
added Miss Rebecca Wright soberly. “My
good gracious, ain’t this a starved-lookin’
place? It makes me ache to think them
nice Bray girls has to brook it here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The sorrel horse, though somewhat puzzled
by an unexpected deviation from his
homeward way, willingly came to a stand by
the gnawed corner of the dooryard fence,
which evidently served as hitching-place.
Two or three ragged old hens were picking
about the yard, and at last a face appeared
at the kitchen window, tied up in a handkerchief,
as if it were a case of toothache. By
the time our friends reached the side door
next this window, Mrs. Janes came disconsolately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>to open it for them, shutting it again
as soon as possible, though the air felt more
chilly inside the house.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take seats,” said Mrs. Janes briefly.
“You’ll have to see me just as I be. I have
been suffering these four days with the ague,
and everything to do. Mr. Janes is to
court, on the jury. ’Twas inconvenient
to spare him. I should be pleased to have
you lay off your things.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Comfortable Mrs. Trimble looked about
the cheerless kitchen, and could not think
of anything to say; so she smiled blandly
and shook her head in answer to the invitation.
“We’ll just set a few minutes
with you, to pass the time o’ day, an’ then
we must go in an’ have a word with the
Miss Brays, bein’ old acquaintance. It
ain’t been so we could git to call on ’em before.
I don’t know ’s you’re acquainted
with Miss R’becca Wright. She’s been out
of town a good deal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I heard she was stopping over to Plainfields
with her brother’s folks,” replied Mrs.
Janes, rocking herself with irregular motion,
as she sat close to the stove. “Got back
some time in the fall, I believe?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes’m,” said Miss Rebecca, with an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>undue sense of guilt and conviction. “We’ve
been to the installation over to the East
Parish, an’ thought we’d stop in; we took
this road home to see if ’twas any better.
How is the Miss Brays gettin’ on?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They’re well ’s common,” answered
Mrs. Janes grudgingly. “I was put out with
Mr. Janes for fetchin’ of ’em here, with
all I’ve got to do, an’ I own I was kind o’
surly to ’em ’long to the first of it. He gits
the money from the town, an’ it helps him
out; but he bid ’em off for five dollars a
month, an’ we can’t do much for ’em at no
such price as that. I went an’ dealt with
the selec’men, an’ made ’em promise to find
their firewood an’ some other things extra.
They was glad to get rid o’ the matter the
fourth time I went, an’ would ha’ promised
’most anything. But Mr. Janes don’t keep
me half the time in oven-wood, he’s off so
much, an’ we was cramped o’ room, any way.
I have to store things up garrit a good deal,
an’ that keeps me trampin’ right through
their room. I do the best for ’em I can,
Mis’ Trimble, but ’t ain’t so easy for me
as ’tis for you, with all your means to do
with.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The poor woman looked pinched and miserable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>herself, though it was evident that
she had no gift at house or home keeping.
Mrs. Trimble’s heart was wrung with pain,
as she thought of the unwelcome inmates of
such a place; but she held her peace bravely,
while Miss Rebecca again gave some brief
information in regard to the installation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You go right up them back stairs,” the
hostess directed at last. “I’m glad some o’
you church folks has seen fit to come an’
visit ’em. There ain’t been nobody here
this long spell, an’ they’ve aged a sight
since they come. They always send down a
taste out of your baskets, Mis’ Trimble, an’
I relish it, I tell you. I’ll shut the door
after you, if you don’t object. I feel every
draught o’ cold air.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve always heard she was a great hand
to make a poor mouth. Wa’n’t she from
somewheres up Parsley way?” whispered
Miss Rebecca, as they stumbled in the half-light.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Poor meechin’ body, wherever she come
from,” replied Mrs. Trimble, as she knocked
at the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was silence for a moment after this
unusual sound; then one of the Bray sisters
opened the door. The eager guests stared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>into a small, low room, brown with age, and
gray, too, as if former dust and cobwebs
could not be made wholly to disappear.
The two elderly women who stood there
looked like captives. Their withered faces
wore a look of apprehension, and the room
itself was more bare and plain than was
fitting to their evident refinement of character
and self-respect. There was an uncovered
small table in the middle of the
floor, with some crackers on a plate; and,
for some reason or other, this added a great
deal to the general desolation.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Miss Ann Bray, the elder sister, who
carried her right arm in a sling, with piteously
drooping fingers, gazed at the visitors
with radiant joy. She had not seen them
arrive.</p>

<p class='c011'>The one window gave only the view at
the back of the house, across the fields, and
their coming was indeed a surprise. The
next minute she was laughing and crying
together. “Oh, sister!” she said, “if here
ain’t our dear Mis’ Trimble!—an’ my
heart o’ goodness, ’tis ’Becca Wright, too!
What dear good creatur’s you be! I’ve
felt all day as if something good was goin’
to happen, an’ was just sayin’ to myself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>’twas most sundown now, but I wouldn’t
let on to Mandany I’d give up hope quite
yet. You see, the scissors stuck in the
floor this very mornin’ an’ it’s always a reliable
sign. There, I’ve got to kiss ye both
again!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know where we can all set,”
lamented sister Mandana. “There ain’t but
the one chair an’ the bed; t’ other chair’s
too rickety; an’ we’ve been promised another
these ten days; but first they’ve forgot
it, an’ next Mis’ Janes can’t spare it,—one
excuse an’ another. I am goin’ to git
a stump o’ wood an’ nail a board on to it,
when I can git outdoor again,” said Mandana,
in a plaintive voice. “There, I ain’t
goin’ to complain o’ nothin’, now you’ve
come,” she added; and the guests sat down,
Mrs. Trimble, as was proper, in the one
chair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We’ve sat on the bed many’s the time
with you, ’Becca, an’ talked over our girl
nonsense, ain’t we? You know where ’twas—in
the little back bedroom we had when
we was girls, an’ used to peek out at our
beaux through the strings o’ mornin’-glories,”
laughed Ann Bray delightedly, her
thin face shining more and more with joy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>“I brought some o’ them mornin’-glory
seeds along when we come away, we’d raised
’em so many years; an’ we got ’em started
all right, but the hens found ’em out. I
declare I chased them poor hens, foolish as
’twas; but the mornin’-glories I’d counted
on a sight to remind me o’ home. You see,
our debts was so large, after my long sickness
an’ all, that we didn’t feel ’twas right to
keep back anything we could help from the
auction.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was impossible for any one to speak for
a moment or two; the sisters felt their own
uprooted condition afresh, and their guests
for the first time really comprehended the
piteous contrast between that neat little
village house, which now seemed a palace of
comfort, and this cold, unpainted upper room
in the remote Janes farmhouse. It was an
unwelcome thought to Mrs. Trimble that
the well-to-do town of Hampden could provide
no better for its poor than this, and her
round face flushed with resentment and the
shame of personal responsibility. “The
girls shall be well settled in the village before
another winter, if I pay their board myself,”
she made an inward resolution, and took
another almost tearful look at the broken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>stove, the miserable bed, and the sisters’ one
hair-covered trunk, on which Mandana was
sitting. But the poor place was filled with
a golden spirit of hospitality.</p>

<p class='c011'>Rebecca was again discoursing eloquently
of the installation; it was so much easier to
speak of general subjects, and the sisters
had evidently been longing to hear some
news. Since the late summer they had not
been to church, and presently Mrs. Trimble
asked the reason.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, don’t you go to pouring out our
woes, Mandy!” begged little old Ann, looking
shy and almost girlish, and as if she
insisted upon playing that life was still all
before them and all pleasure. “Don’t you
go to spoilin’ their visit with our complaints!
They know well ’s we do that changes must
come, an’ we’d been so wonted to our home
things that this come hard at first; but then
they felt for us, I know just as well’s can be.
’Twill soon be summer again, an’ ’tis real
pleasant right out in the fields here, when
there ain’t too hot a spell. I’ve got to know
a sight o’ singin’ birds since we come.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Give me the folks I’ve always known,”
sighed the younger sister, who looked older
than Miss Ann, and less even-tempered.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>“You may have your birds, if you want ’em.
I do re’lly long to go to meetin’ an’ see folks
go by up the aisle. Now, I will speak of it,
Ann, whatever you say. We need, each of
us, a pair o’ good stout shoes an’ rubbers,—ours
are all wore out; an’ we’ve asked an’
asked, an’ they never think to bring ’em,
an’”—</p>

<p class='c011'>Poor old Mandana, on the trunk, covered
her face with her arms and sobbed aloud.
The elder sister stood over her, and patted
her on the thin shoulder like a child, and
tried to comfort her. It crossed Mrs.
Trimble’s mind that it was not the first time
one had wept and the other had comforted.
The sad scene must have been repeated
many times in that long, drear winter. She
would see them forever after in her mind as
fixed as a picture, and her own tears fell
fast.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You didn’t see Mis’ Janes’s cunning
little boy, the next one to the baby, did
you?” asked Ann Bray, turning round
quickly at last, and going cheerfully on with
the conversation. “Now, hush, Mandy,
dear; they’ll think you’re childish! He’s
a dear, friendly little creatur’, an’ likes to
stay with us a good deal, though we feel ’s if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>it ’twas too cold for him, now we are waitin’
to get us more wood.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When I think of the acres o’ woodland in
this town!” groaned Rebecca Wright. “I
believe I’m goin’ to preach next Sunday,
’stead o’ the minister, an’ I’ll make the
sparks fly. I’ve always heard the saying,
‘What’s everybody’s business is nobody’s
business,’ an’ I’ve come to believe it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, don’t you, ’Becca. You’ve happened
on a kind of a poor time with us, but
we’ve got more belongings than you see
here, an’ a good large cluset, where we can
store those things there ain’t room to have
about. You an’ Miss Trimble have happened
on a kind of poor day, you know.
Soon’s I git me some stout shoes an’ rubbers,
as Mandy says, I can fetch home
plenty o’ little dry boughs o’ pine; you remember
I was always a great hand to roam
in the woods? If we could only have a front
room, so ’t we could look out on the road an’
see passin’, an’ was shod for meetin’, I don’
know ’s we should complain. Now we’re
just goin’ to give you what we’ve got, an’
make out with a good welcome. We make
more tea ’n we want in the mornin’, an’ then
let the fire go down, since ’t has been so mild.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>We’ve got a <em>good</em> cluset” (disappearing as
she spoke), “an’ I know this to be good tea,
’cause it’s some o’ yourn, Mis’ Trimble.
An’ here’s our sprigged chiny cups that
R’becca knows by sight, if Mis’ Trimble
don’t. We kep’ out four of ’em, an’ put
the even half dozen with the rest of the auction
stuff. I’ve often wondered who’d got
’em, but I never asked, for fear ’twould be
somebody that would distress us. They was
mother’s, you know.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The four cups were poured, and the little
table pushed to the bed, where Rebecca
Wright still sat, and Mandana, wiping her
eyes, came and joined her. Mrs. Trimble
sat in her chair at the end, and Ann trotted
about the room in pleased content for a
while, and in and out of the closet, as if she
still had much to do; then she came and
stood opposite Mrs. Trimble. She was very
short and small, and there was no painful
sense of her being obliged to stand. The
four cups were not quite full of cold tea,
but there was a clean old tablecloth folded
double, and a plate with three pairs of
crackers neatly piled, and a small—it must
be owned, a very small—piece of hard white
cheese. Then, for a treat, in a glass dish,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>there was a little preserved peach, the last—Miss
Rebecca knew it instinctively—of the
household stores brought from their old
home. It was very sugary, this bit of peach;
and as she helped her guests and sister
Mandy, Miss Ann Bray said, half unconsciously,
as she often had said with less
reason in the old days, “Our preserves ain’t
so good as usual this year; this is beginning
to candy.” Both the guests protested, while
Rebecca added that the taste of it carried
her back, and made her feel young again.
The Brays had always managed to keep one
or two peach-trees alive in their corner of a
garden. “I’ve been keeping this preserve
for a treat,” said her friend. “I’m glad to
have you eat some, ’Becca. Last summer I
often wished you was home an’ could come
an’ see us, ’stead o’ being away off to Plainfields.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The crackers did not taste too dry. Miss
Ann took the last of the peach on her own
cracker; there could not have been quite a
small spoonful, after the others were helped,
but she asked them first if they would not
have some more. Then there was a silence,
and in the silence a wave of tender feeling
rose high in the hearts of the four elderly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>women. At this moment the setting sun
flooded the poor plain room with light; the
unpainted wood was all of a golden-brown,
and Ann Bray, with her gray hair and aged
face, stood at the head of the table in a
kind of aureole. Mrs. Trimble’s face was all
aquiver as she looked at her; she thought of
the text about two or three being gathered
together, and was half afraid.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe we ought to ’ve asked Mis’
Janes if she wouldn’t come up,” said Ann.
“She’s real good feelin’, but she’s had it
very hard, an gits discouraged. I can’t find
that she’s ever had anything real pleasant
to look back to, as we have. There, next
time we’ll make a good heartenin’ time for
her too.”</p>

<p class='c012'>The sorrel horse had taken a long nap by
the gnawed fence-rail, and the cool air after
sundown made him impatient to be gone.
The two friends jolted homeward in the
gathering darkness, through the stiffening
mud, and neither Mrs. Trimble nor Rebecca
Wright said a word until they were out of
sight as well as out of sound of the Janes
house. Time must elapse before they could
reach a more familiar part of the road and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>resume conversation on its natural level.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I consider myself to blame,” insisted
Mrs. Trimble at last. “I haven’t no words
of accusation for nobody else, an’ I ain’t
one to take comfort in calling names to the
board o’ selec’<em>men</em>. I make no reproaches,
an’ I take it all on my own shoulders; but
I’m goin’ to stir about me, I tell you! I
shall begin early to-morrow. They’re goin’
back to their own house,— it’s been standin’
empty all winter,—an’ the town’s goin’
to give ’em the rent an’ what firewood they
need; it won’t come to more than the board’s
payin’ out now. An’ you an’ me’ll take this
same horse an’ wagon, an’ ride an go afoot
by turns, an’ git means enough together to
buy back their furniture an’ whatever was
sold at that plaguey auction; an’ then we’ll
put it all back, an’ tell ’em they’ve got to
move to a new place, an’ just carry ’em right
back again where they come from. An’
don’t you never tell, R’becca, but here I be
a widow woman, layin’ up what I make from
my farm for nobody knows who, an’ I’m
goin’ to do for them Bray girls all I’m a
mind to. I should be sca’t to wake up in
heaven, an’ hear anybody there ask how the
Bray girls was. Don’t talk to me about the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>town o’ Hampden, an’ don’t ever let me hear
the name o’ town poor! I’m ashamed to go
home an’ see what’s set out for supper. I
wish I’d brought ’em right along.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was goin’ to ask if we couldn’t git the
new doctor to go up an’ do somethin’ for
poor Ann’s arm,” said Miss Rebecca. “They
say he’s very smart. If she could get so ’s
to braid straw or hook rugs again, she’d
soon be earnin’ a little somethin’. An’ may
be he could do somethin’ for Mandy’s eyes.
They did use to live so neat an’ ladylike.
Somehow I couldn’t speak to tell ’em there
that ’twas I bought them six best cups an’
saucers, time of the auction; they went very
low, as everything else did, an’ I thought I
could save it some other way. They shall
have ’em back an’ welcome. You’re real
whole-hearted, Mis’ Trimble. I expect
Ann’ll be sayin’ that her father’s child’n
wa’n’t goin’ to be left desolate, an’ that all
the bread he cast on the water’s comin’ back
through you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t care what she says, dear creatur’!”
exclaimed Mrs. Trimble. “I’m full
o’ regrets I took time for that installation,
an’ set there seepin’ in a lot o’ talk this whole
day long, except for its kind of bringin’ us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>to the Bray girls. I wish to my heart ’twas
to-morrow mornin’ a’ready, an’ I a-startin’
for the selec’<em>men</em>.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>THE HILTONS’ HOLIDAY.</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c009'>I.</h3>

<p class='c010'>There was a bright, full moon in the
clear sky, and the sunset was still shining
faintly in the west. Dark woods stood all
about the old Hilton farmhouse, save down
the hill, westward, where lay the shadowy
fields which John Hilton, and his father before
him, had cleared and tilled with much
toil,—the small fields to which they had
given the industry and even affection of
their honest lives.</p>

<p class='c011'>John Hilton was sitting on the doorstep
of his house. As he moved his head in and
out of the shadows, turning now and then
to speak to his wife, who sat just within
the doorway, one could see his good face,
rough and somewhat unkempt, as if he were
indeed a creature of the shady woods and
brown earth, instead of the noisy town. It
was late in the long spring evening, and he
had just come from the lower field as cheerful
as a boy, proud of having finished the
planting of his potatoes.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>“I had to do my last row mostly by feelin’,”
he said to his wife. “I’m proper
glad I pushed through, an’ went back an’
ended off after supper. ’Twould have
taken me a good part o’ to-morrow mornin’,
an’ broke my day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tain’t no use for ye to work yourself
all to pieces, John,” answered the woman
quickly. “I declare it does seem harder
than ever that we couldn’t have kep’ our
boy; he’d been comin’ fourteen years old
this fall, most a grown man, and he’d work
right ’longside of ye now the whole time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Twas hard to lose him; I do seem to
miss little John,” said the father sadly.
“I expect there was reasons why ’twas best.
I feel able an’ smart to work; my father was
a girt strong man, an’ a monstrous worker
afore me. ’Tain’t that; but I was thinkin’
by myself to-day what a sight o’ company
the boy would ha’ been. You know, small ’s
he was, how I could trust to leave him anywheres
with the team, and how he’d beseech
to go with me wherever I was goin’;
always right in my tracks I used to tell ’em.
Poor little John, for all he was so young he
had a great deal o’ judgment; he’d ha’
made a likely man.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>The mother sighed heavily as she sat
within the shadow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But then there’s the little girls, a sight
o’ help an’ company,” urged the father
eagerly, as if it were wrong to dwell upon
sorrow and loss. “Katy, she’s most as
good as a boy, except that she ain’t very
rugged. She’s a real little farmer, she’s
helped me a sight this spring; an’ you’ve
got Susan Ellen, that makes a complete
little housekeeper for ye as far as she’s
learnt. I don’t see but we’re better off
than most folks, each on us having a workmate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s so, John,” acknowledged Mrs.
Hilton wistfully, beginning to rock steadily
in her straight, splint-bottomed chair. It
was always a good sign when she rocked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where be the little girls so late?” asked
their father. “’Tis gettin’ long past eight
o’clock. I don’t know when we’ve all set
up so late, but it’s so kind o’ summer-like
an’ pleasant. Why, where be they gone?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve told ye; only over to Becker’s
folks,” answered the mother. “I don’t see
myself what keeps ’em so late; they beseeched
me after supper till I let ’em go.
They’re all in a dazzle with the new teacher;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>she asked ’em to come over. They say she’s
unusual smart with ’rethmetic, but she has
a kind of a gorpen look to me. She’s goin’
to give Katy some pieces for her doll, but I
told Katy she ought to be ashamed wantin’
dolls’ pieces, big as she’s gettin’ to be. I
don’t know ’s she ought, though; she ain’t
but nine this summer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let her take her comfort,” said the kind-hearted
man. “Them things draws her to
the teacher, an’ makes them acquainted.
Katy’s shy with new folks, more so ’n Susan
Ellen, who’s of the business kind. Katy’s
shy-feelin’ and wishful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know but she is,” agreed the
mother slowly. “Ain’t it sing’lar how well
acquainted you be with that one, an’ I with
Susan Ellen? ’Twas always so from the
first. I’m doubtful sometimes our Katy
ain’t one that’ll be like to get married—anyways
not about here. She lives right
with herself, but Susan Ellen ain’t nothin’
when she’s alone, she’s always after company;
all the boys is waitin’ on her a’ready.
I ain’t afraid but she’ll take her pick when
the time comes. I expect to see Susan Ellen
well settled,—she feels grown up now,—but
Katy don’t care one mite ’bout none o’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>them things. She wants to be rovin’ out o’
doors. I do believe she’d stand an’ hark
to a bird the whole forenoon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps she’ll grow up to be a teacher,”
suggested John Hilton. “She takes to her
book more ’n the other one. I should like
one on ’em to be a teacher same ’s my mother
was. They’re good girls as anybody’s got.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So they be,” said the mother, with unusual
gentleness, and the creak of her rocking-chair
was heard, regular as the ticking
of a clock. The night breeze stirred in the
great woods, and the sound of a brook that
went falling down the hillside grew louder
and louder. Now and then one could hear
the plaintive chirp of a bird. The moon
glittered with whiteness like a winter moon,
and shone upon the low-roofed house until
its small window-panes gleamed like silver,
and one could almost see the colors of a
blooming bush of lilac that grew in a sheltered
angle by the kitchen door. There was
an incessant sound of frogs in the lowlands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be you sound asleep, John?” asked the
wife presently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know but what I was a’most,”
said the tired man, starting a little. “I
should laugh if I was to fall sound asleep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>right here on the step; ’tis the bright
night, I expect, makes my eyes feel heavy,
an’ ’tis so peaceful. I was up an’ dressed
a little past four an’ out to work. Well,
well!” and he laughed sleepily and rubbed
his eyes. “Where’s the little girls? I’d
better step along an’ meet ’em.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wouldn’t just yet; they’ll get home
all right, but ’tis late for ’em certain. I
don’t want ’em keepin’ Mis’ Becker’s folks
up neither. There, le’ ’s wait a few minutes,”
urged Mrs. Hilton.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve be’n a-thinkin’ all day I’d like
to give the child’n some kind of a treat,”
said the father, wide awake now. “I hurried
up my work ’cause I had it so in mind.
They don’t have the opportunities some do,
an’ I want ’em to know the world, an’ not
stay right here on the farm like a couple
o’ bushes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They’re a sight better off not to be so
full o’ notions as some is,” protested the
mother suspiciously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Certain,” answered the farmer; “but
they’re good, bright child’n, an’ commencin’
to take a sight o’ notice. I want ’em to
have all we can give ’em. I want ’em to
see how other folks does things.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“Why, so do I,”—here the rocking-chair
stopped ominously,—“but so long ’s they’re
contented”—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Contented ain’t all in this world; hopper-toads
may have that quality an’ spend
all their time a-blinkin’. I don’t know ’s
bein’ contented is all there is to look for in
a child. Ambition’s somethin’ to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now you’ve got your mind on to some
plot or other.” (The rocking-chair began
to move again.) “Why can’t you talk right
out?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tain’t nothin’ special,” answered the
good man, a little ruffled; he was never
prepared for his wife’s mysterious powers of
divination. “Well there, you do find things
out the master! I only thought perhaps
I’d take ’em to-morrow, an’ go off somewhere
if ’twas a good day. I’ve been
promisin’ for a good while I’d take ’em to
Topham Corners; they’ve never been there
since they was very small.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believe you want a good time yourself.
You ain’t never got over bein’ a boy.”
Mrs. Hilton seemed much amused. “There,
go if you want to an’ take ’em; they’ve
got their summer hats an’ new dresses. I
don’t know o’ nothin’ that stands in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>way. I should sense it better if there was
a circus or anythin’ to go to. Why don’t
you wait an’ let the girls pick ’em some
strawberries or nice ros’berries, and then
they could take an’ sell ’em to the stores?”</p>

<p class='c011'>John Hilton reflected deeply. “I should
like to get me some good yellow-turnip seed
to plant late. I ain’t more ’n satisfied with
what I’ve been gettin’ o’ late years o’ Ira
Speed. An’ I’m goin’ to provide me with
a good hoe; mine ’s gettin’ wore out an’ all
shackly. I can’t seem to fix it good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Them’s excuses,” observed Mrs. Hilton,
with friendly tolerance. “You just
cover up the hoe with somethin’, if you get
it—I would. Ira Speed ’s so jealous he’ll
remember it of you this twenty year, your
goin’ an’ buyin’ a new hoe o’ anybody but
him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve always thought ’twas a free country,”
said John Hilton soberly. “I don’t
want to vex Ira neither; he favors us all he
can in trade. ’Tis difficult for him to spare
a cent, but he’s as honest as daylight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this moment there was a sudden sound
of young voices, and a pair of young figures
came out from the shadow of the woods into
the moonlighted open space. An old cock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>crowed loudly from his perch in the shed,
as if he were a herald of royalty. The little
girls were hand in hand, and a brisk young
dog capered about them as they came.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wa’n’t it dark gittin’ home through
the woods this time o’ night?” asked the
mother hastily, and not without reproach.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t love to have you gone so late;
mother an’ me was timid about ye, and
you’ve kep’ Mis’ Becker’s folks up, I expect,”
said their father regretfully. “I
don’t want to have it said that my little
girls ain’t got good manners.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The teacher had a party,” chirped Susan
Ellen, the elder of the two children.
“Goin’ home from school she asked the
Grover boys, an’ Mary an’ Sarah Speed.
An’ Mis’ Becker was real pleasant to us:
she passed round some cake, an’ handed us
sap sugar on one of her best plates, an’
we played games an’ sung some pieces too.
Mis’ Becker thought we did real well. I
can pick out most of a tune on the cabinet
organ; teacher says she’ll give me
lessons.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want to know, dear!” exclaimed John
Hilton.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, an’ we played Copenhagen, an’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>took sides spellin’, an’ Katy beat everybody
spellin’ there was there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Katy had not spoken; she was not so
strong as her sister, and while Susan Ellen
stood a step or two away addressing her
eager little audience, Katy had seated herself
close to her father on the doorstep. He
put his arm around her shoulders, and drew
her close to his side, where she stayed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ain’t you got nothin’ to tell, daughter?”
he asked, looking down fondly; and
Katy gave a pleased little sigh for answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell ’em what’s goin’ to be the last day
o’ school, and about our trimmin’ the schoolhouse,”
she said; and Susan Ellen gave the
programme in most spirited fashion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Twill be a great time,” said the mother,
when she had finished. “I don’t see
why folks wants to go trapesin’ off to strange
places when such things is happenin’ right
about ’em.” But the children did not observe
her mysterious air. “Come, you must
step yourselves right to bed!”</p>

<p class='c011'>They all went into the dark, warm house;
the bright moon shone upon it steadily all
night, and the lilac flowers were shaken by
no breath of wind until the early dawn.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>II.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The Hiltons always waked early. So did
their neighbors, the crows and song-sparrows
and robins, the light-footed foxes and
squirrels in the woods. When John Hilton
waked, before five o’clock, an hour later
than usual because he had sat up so late, he
opened the house door and came out into
the yard, crossing the short green turf hurriedly
as if the day were too far spent for
any loitering. The magnitude of the plan
for taking a whole day of pleasure confronted
him seriously, but the weather was
fair, and his wife, whose disapproval could
not have been set aside, had accepted and
even smiled upon the great project. It was
inevitable now, that he and the children
should go to Topham Corners. Mrs. Hilton
had the pleasure of waking them, and
telling the news.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a few minutes they came frisking out
to talk over the great plans. The cattle
were already fed, and their father was milking.
The only sign of high festivity was the
wagon pulled out into the yard, with both
seats put in as if it were Sunday; but Mr.
Hilton still wore his every-day clothes, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>Susan Ellen suffered instantly from disappointment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ain’t we goin’, father?” she asked complainingly;
but he nodded and smiled at her,
even though the cow, impatient to get to
pasture, kept whisking her rough tail across
his face. He held his head down and spoke
cheerfully, in spite of this vexation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, sister, we’re goin’ certain’, an’
goin’ to have a great time too.” Susan
Ellen thought that he seemed like a boy at
that delightful moment, and felt new sympathy
and pleasure at once. “You go an’ help
mother about breakfast an’ them things; we
want to get off quick ’s we can. You coax
mother now, both on ye, an’ see if she won’t
go with us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She said she wouldn’t be hired to,” responded
Susan Ellen. “She says it’s goin’
to be hot, an’ she’s laid out to go over an’
see how her aunt Tamsen Brooks is this
afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The father gave a little sigh; then he took
heart again. The truth was that his wife
made light of the contemplated pleasure,
and, much as he usually valued her companionship
and approval, he was sure that
they should have a better time without her.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>It was impossible, however, not to feel guilty
of disloyalty at the thought. Even though
she might be completely unconscious of his
best ideals, he only loved her and the ideals
the more, and bent his energies to satisfying
her indefinite expectations. His wife
still kept much of that youthful beauty
which Susan Ellen seemed likely to reproduce.</p>

<p class='c011'>An hour later the best wagon was ready,
and the great expedition set forth. The
little dog sat apart, and barked as if it fell
entirely upon him to voice the general excitement.
Both seats were in the wagon, but
the empty place testified to Mrs. Hilton’s
unyielding disposition. She had wondered
why one broad seat would not do, but John
Hilton meekly suggested that the wagon
looked better with both. The little girls
sat on the back seat dressed alike in their
Sunday hats of straw with blue ribbons, and
their little plaid shawls pinned neatly about
their small shoulders. They wore gray
thread gloves, and sat very straight. Susan
Ellen was half a head the taller, but otherwise,
from behind, they looked much alike.
As for their father, he was in his Sunday
best,—a plain black coat, and a winter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>hat of felt, which was heavy and rusty-looking
for that warm early summer day. He
had it in mind to buy a new straw hat at
Topham, so that this with the turnip seed
and the hoe made three important reasons
for going.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Remember an’ lay off your shawls when
you get there, an’ carry them over your
arms,” said the mother, clucking like an excited
hen to her chickens. “They’ll do to
keep the dust off your new dresses goin’ an’
comin’. An’ when you eat your dinners
don’t get spots on you, an’ don’t point at
folks as you ride by, an’ stare, or they’ll
know you come from the country. An’
John, you call into Cousin Ad’line Marlow’s
an’ see how they all be, an’ tell her I expect
her over certain to stop awhile before
hayin’. It always eases her phthisic to git
up here on the high land, an’ I’ve got a new
notion about doin’ over her best-room carpet
sence I see her that’ll save rippin’ one
breadth. An’ don’t come home all wore
out; an’, John, don’t you go an’ buy me
no kickshaws to fetch home. I ain’t a
child, an’ you ain’t got no money to waste.
I expect you’ll go, like ’s not, an’ buy you
some kind of a foolish boy’s hat; do look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>an’ see if it’s reasonable good straw, an’
won’t splinter all off round the edge. An’
you mind, John”—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes, hold on!” cried John impatiently;
then he cast a last affectionate, reassuring
look at her face, flushed with the
hurry and responsibility of starting them off
in proper shape. “I wish you was goin’
too,” he said, smiling. “I do so!” Then
the old horse started, and they went out at
the bars, and began the careful long descent
of the hill. The young dog, tethered
to the lilac-bush, was frantic with piteous
appeals; the little girls piped their eager
good-bys again and again, and their father
turned many times to look back and wave
his hand. As for their mother, she stood
alone and watched them out of sight.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was one place far out on the high-road
where she could catch a last glimpse of
the wagon, and she waited what seemed a
very long time until it appeared and then
was lost to sight again behind a low hill.
“They’re nothin’ but a pack o’ child’n together,”
she said aloud; and then felt lonelier
than she expected. She even stooped
and patted the unresigned little dog as she
passed him, going into the house.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>The occasion was so much more important
than any one had foreseen that both
the little girls were speechless. It seemed
at first like going to church in new clothes,
or to a funeral; they hardly knew how to
behave at the beginning of a whole day of
pleasure. They made grave bows at such
persons of their acquaintance as happened
to be straying in the road. Once or twice
they stopped before a farmhouse, while their
father talked an inconsiderately long time
with some one about the crops and the
weather, and even dwelt upon town business
and the doings of the selectmen, which might
be talked of at any time. The explanations
that he gave of their excursion seemed quite
unnecessary. It was made entirely clear
that he had a little business to do at Topham
Corners, and thought he had better give
the little girls a ride; they had been very
steady at school, and he had finished planting,
and could take the day as well as not.
Soon, however, they all felt as if such an excursion
were an every-day affair, and Susan
Ellen began to ask eager questions, while
Katy silently sat apart enjoying herself as
she never had done before. She liked to
see the strange houses, and the children who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>belonged to them; it was delightful to find
flowers that she knew growing all along
the road, no matter how far she went from
home. Each small homestead looked its best
and pleasantest, and shared the exquisite
beauty that early summer made,—shared
the luxury of greenness and floweriness that
decked the rural world. There was an
early peony or a late lilac in almost every
dooryard.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was seventeen miles to Topham. After
a while they seemed very far from home,
having left the hills far behind, and descended
to a great level country with fewer
tracts of woodland, and wider fields where
the crops were much more forward. The
houses were all painted, and the roads were
smoother and wider. It had been so pleasant
driving along that Katy dreaded going
into the strange town when she first caught
sight of it, though Susan Ellen kept asking
with bold fretfulness if they were not almost
there. They counted the steeples of four
churches, and their father presently showed
them the Topham Academy, where their
grandmother once went to school, and told
them that perhaps some day they would go
there too. Katy’s heart gave a strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>leap; it was such a tremendous thing to
think of, but instantly the suggestion was
transformed for her into one of the certainties
of life. She looked with solemn awe at
the tall belfry, and the long rows of windows
in the front of the academy, there where it
stood high and white among the clustering
trees. She hoped that they were going to
drive by, but something forbade her taking
the responsibility of saying so.</p>

<p class='c011'>Soon the children found themselves among
the crowded village houses. Their father
turned to look at them with affectionate solicitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now sit up straight and appear pretty,”
he whispered to them. “We’re among the
best people now, an’ I want folks to think
well of you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess we’re as good as they be,” remarked
Susan Ellen, looking at some innocent
passers-by with dark suspicion, but
Katy tried indeed to sit straight, and folded
her hands prettily in her lap, and wished
with all her heart to be pleasing for her
father’s sake. Just then an elderly woman
saw the wagon and the sedate party it carried,
and smiled so kindly that it seemed to
Katy as if Topham Corners had welcomed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>and received them. She smiled back again
as if this hospitable person were an old
friend, and entirely forgot that the eyes of
all Topham had been upon her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, now we’re coming to an elegant
house that I want you to see; you’ll never
forget it,” said John Hilton. “It’s where
Judge Masterson lives, the great lawyer;
the handsomest house in the county, everybody
says.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you know him, father?” asked Susan
Ellen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do,” answered John Hilton proudly.
“Him and my mother went to school together
in their young days, and were always
called the two best scholars of their time.
The judge called to see her once; he
stopped to our house to see her when I was
a boy. An’ then, some years ago—you’ve
heard me tell how I was on the jury, an’
when he heard my name spoken he looked at
me sharp, and asked if I wa’n’t the son of
Catharine Winn, an’ spoke most beautiful
of your grandmother, an’ how well he remembered
their young days together.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I like to hear about that,” said Katy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She had it pretty hard, I’m afraid, up
on the old farm. She was keepin’ school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>in our district when father married her—that’s
the main reason I backed ’em down
when they wanted to tear the old schoolhouse
all to pieces,” confided John Hilton, turning
eagerly. “They all say she lived longer up
here on the hill than she could anywhere,
but she never had her health. I wa’n’t but
a boy when she died. Father an’ me lived
alone afterward till the time your mother
come; ’twas a good while, too; I wa’n’t
married so young as some. ’Twas lonesome,
I tell you; father was plumb discouraged
losin’ of his wife, an’ her long sickness
an’ all set him back, an’ we’d work all day
on the land an’ never say a word. I s’pose
’tis bein’ so lonesome early in life that
makes me so pleased to have some nice girls
growin’ up round me now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a tone in her father’s voice that
drew Katy’s heart toward him with new
affection. She dimly understood, but Susan
Ellen was less interested. They had often
heard this story before, but to one child it
was always new and to the other old. Susan
Ellen was apt to think it tiresome to
hear about her grandmother, who, being
dead, was hardly worth talking about.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s Judge Masterson’s place,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>their father in an every-day manner, as they
turned a corner, and came into full view of
the beautiful old white house standing behind
its green trees and terraces and lawns.
The children had never imagined anything
so stately and fine, and even Susan Ellen
exclaimed with pleasure. At that moment
they saw an old gentleman, who carried
himself with great dignity, coming slowly
down the wide box-bordered path toward the
gate.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There he is now, there’s the judge!”
whispered John Hilton excitedly, reining
his horse quickly to the green roadside.
“He’s goin’ down-town to his office; we
can wait right here an’ see him. I can’t
expect him to remember me; it’s been a
good many years. Now you are goin’ to
see the great Judge Masterson!”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a quiver of expectation in their
hearts. The judge stopped at his gate, hesitating
a moment before he lifted the latch,
and glanced up the street at the country
wagon with its two prim little girls on the
back seat, and the eager man who drove.
They seemed to be waiting for something;
the old horse was nibbling at the fresh
roadside grass. The judge was used to being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>looked at with interest, and responded
now with a smile as he came out to the
sidewalk, and unexpectedly turned their
way. Then he suddenly lifted his hat with
grave politeness, and came directly toward
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-morning, Mr. Hilton,” he said.
“I am very glad to see you, sir;” and Mr.
Hilton, the little girls’ own father, took off
his hat with equal courtesy, and bent forward
to shake hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Susan Ellen cowered and wished herself
away, but little Katy sat straighter than
ever, with joy in her father’s pride and
pleasure shining in her pale, flower-like
little face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“These are your daughters, I am sure,”
said the old gentleman kindly, taking Susan
Ellen’s limp and reluctant hand; but when
he looked at Katy, his face brightened.
“How she recalls your mother!” he said
with great feeling. “I am glad to see this
dear child. You must come to see me with
your father, my dear,” he added, still looking
at her. “Bring both the little girls,
and let them run about the old garden; the
cherries are just getting ripe,” said Judge
Masterson hospitably. “Perhaps you will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>have time to stop this afternoon as you go
home?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I should call it a great pleasure if you
would come and see us again some time.
You may be driving our way, sir,” said
John Hilton.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not very often in these days,” answered
the old judge. “I thank you for the kind
invitation. I should like to see the fine view
again from your hill westward. Can I serve
you in any way while you are in town?
Good-by, my little friends!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then they parted, but not before Katy,
the shy Katy, whose band the judge still
held unconsciously while he spoke, had
reached forward as he said good-by, and
lifted her face to kiss him. She could not
have told why, except that she felt drawn to
something in the serious, worn face. For
the first time in her life the child had felt
the charm of manners; perhaps she owned
a kinship between that which made him what
he was, and the spark of nobleness and purity
in her own simple soul. She turned
again and again to look back at him as they
drove away.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now you have seen one of the first gentlemen
in the country,” said their father.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“It was worth comin’ twice as far”—but
he did not say any more, nor turn as usual
to look in the children’s faces.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the chief business street of Topham a
great many country wagons like the Hiltons’
were fastened to the posts, and there
seemed to our holiday-makers to be a great
deal of noise and excitement.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I’ve got to do my errands, and we
can let the horse rest and feed,” said John
Hilton. “I’ll slip his headstall right off,
an’ put on his halter. I’m goin’ to buy
him a real good treat o’ oats. First we’ll
go an’ buy me my straw hat; I feel as if
this one looked a little past to wear in Topham.
We’ll buy the things we want, an’
then we’ll walk all along the street, so you
can look in the windows an’ see the han’some
things, same’s your mother likes to.
What was it mother told you about your
shawls?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To take ’em off an’ carry ’em over our
arms,” piped Susan Ellen, without comment,
but in the interest of alighting and finding
themselves afoot upon the pavement the
shawls were forgotten. The children stood
at the doorway of a shop while their father
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>went inside, and they tried to see what the
Topham shapes of bonnets were like, as
their mother had advised them; but everything
was exciting and confusing, and they
could arrive at no decision. When Mr.
Hilton came out with a hat in his hand to
be seen in a better light, Katy whispered
that she wished he would buy a shiny one
like Judge Masterson’s; but her father only
smiled and shook his head, and said that
they were plain folks, he and Katy. There
were dry-goods for sale in the same shop,
and a young clerk who was measuring linen
kindly pulled off some pretty labels with
gilded edges and gay pictures, and gave
them to the little girls, to their exceeding
joy. He may have had small sisters at
home, this friendly lad, for he took pains to
find two pretty blue boxes besides, and was
rewarded by their beaming gratitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a famous day; they even became
used to seeing so many people pass. The
village was full of its morning activity, and
Susan Ellen gained a new respect for her
father, and an increased sense of her own
consequence, because even in Topham several
persons knew him and called him familiarly
by name. The meeting with an old man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>who had once been a neighbor seemed to give
Mr. Hilton the greatest pleasure. The old
man called to them from a house doorway
as they were passing, and they all went in.
The children seated themselves wearily on
the wooden step, but their father shook his
old friend eagerly by the hand, and declared
that he was delighted to see him so well and
enjoying the fine weather.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, yes,” said the old man, in a feeble,
quavering voice, “I’m astonishin’ well for
my age. I don’t complain, John, I don’t
complain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>They talked long together of people whom
they had known in the past, and Katy, being
a little tired, was glad to rest, and sat
still with her hands folded, looking about
the front yard. There were some kinds of
flowers that she never had seen before.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is the one that looks like my mother,”
her father said, and touched Katy’s
shoulder to remind her to stand up and let
herself be seen. “Judge Masterson saw
the resemblance; we met him at his gate this
morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, she certain does look like your mother,
John,” said the old man, looking pleasantly
at Katy, who found that she liked him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>better than at first. “She does, certain;
the best of young folks is, they remind us
of the old ones. ’Tis nateral to cling to
life, folks say, but for me, I git impatient
at times. Most everybody’s gone now, an’
I want to be goin’. ’Tis somethin’ before
me, an’ I want to have it over with. I want
to be there ’long o’ the rest o’ the folks. I
expect to last quite a while though; I may
see ye couple o’ times more, John.”</p>

<p class='c011'>John Hilton responded cheerfully, and
the children were urged to pick some flowers.
The old man awed them with his impatience
to be gone. There was such a townful of
people about him, and he seemed as lonely
as if he were the last survivor of a former
world. Until that moment they had felt as
if everything were just beginning.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now I want to buy somethin’ pretty for
your mother,” said Mr. Hilton, as they went
soberly away down the street, the children
keeping fast hold of his hands. “By now
the old horse will have eat his dinner and
had a good rest, so pretty soon we can jog
along home. I’m goin’ to take you round
by the academy, and the old North Meetinghouse
where Dr. Barstow used to preach.
Can’t you think o’ somethin’ that your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>mother ’d want?” he asked suddenly, confronted
by a man’s difficulty of choice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She was talkin’ about wantin’ a new
pepper-box, one day; the top o’ the old one
won’t stay on,” suggested Susan Ellen, with
delightful readiness. “Can’t we have some
candy, father?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, ma’am,” said John Hilton, smiling
and swinging her hand to and fro as they
walked. “I feel as if some would be good
myself. What’s all this?” They were passing
a photographer’s doorway with its enticing
array of portraits. “I do declare!”
he exclaimed excitedly, “I’m goin’ to have
our pictures taken; ’twill please your mother
more ’n a little.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was, perhaps, the greatest triumph of
the day, except the delightful meeting with
the judge; they sat in a row, with the father
in the middle, and there was no doubt as
to the excellence of the likeness. The best
hats had to be taken off because they cast a
shadow, but they were not missed, as their
owners had feared. Both Susan Ellen and
Katy looked their brightest and best; their
eager young faces would forever shine there;
the joy of the holiday was mirrored in the
little picture. They did not know why their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>father was so pleased with it; they would
not know until age had dowered them with
the riches of association and remembrance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Just at nightfall the Hiltons reached home
again, tired out and happy. Katy had
climbed over into the front seat beside her
father, because that was always her place
when they went to church on Sundays. It
was a cool evening, there was a fresh sea
wind that brought a light mist with it, and
the sky was fast growing cloudy. Somehow
the children looked different; it seemed to
their mother as if they had grown older and
taller since they went away in the morning,
and as if they belonged to the town now as
much as to the country. The greatness of
their day’s experience had left her far behind;
the day had been silent and lonely
without them, and she had had their supper
ready, and been watching anxiously, ever
since five o’clock. As for the children themselves
they had little to say at first—they
had eaten their luncheon early on the way
to Topham. Susan Ellen was childishly
cross, but Katy was pathetic and wan. They
could hardly wait to show the picture, and
their mother was as much pleased as everybody
had expected.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>“There, what did make you wear your
shawls?” she exclaimed a moment afterward,
reproachfully. “You ain’t been an’ wore
’em all day long? I wanted folks to see
how pretty your new dresses was, if I did
make ’em. Well, well! I wish more ’n ever
now I’d gone an’ seen to ye!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ here’s the pepper-box!” said Katy,
in a pleased, unconscious tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That really is what I call beautiful,”
said Mrs. Hilton, after a long and doubtful
look. “Our other one was only tin. I
never did look so high as a chiny one with
flowers, but I can get us another any time
for every day. That’s a proper hat, as
good as you could have got, John. Where’s
your new hoe?” she asked as he came toward
her from the barn, smiling with satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I declare to Moses if I didn’t forget all
about it,” meekly acknowledged the leader
of the great excursion. “That an’ my yellow
turnip seed, too; they went clean out o’
my head, there was so many other things to
think of. But ’tain’t no sort o’ matter; I
can get a hoe just as well to Ira Speed’s.”</p>

<p class='c011'>His wife could not help laughing. “You
an’ the little girls have had a great time.
They was full o’ wonder to me about everything,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>and I expect they’ll talk about it for
a week. I guess we was right about havin’
’em see somethin’ more o’ the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” answered John Hilton, with humility,
“yes, we did have a beautiful day.
I didn’t expect so much. They looked as
nice as anybody, and appeared so modest an’
pretty. The little girls will remember it
perhaps by an’ by. I guess they won’t
never forget this day they had ’long o’ father.”</p>

<p class='c012'>It was evening again, the frogs were piping
in the lower meadows, and in the woods,
higher up the great hill, a little owl began
to hoot. The sea air, salt and heavy, was
blowing in over the country at the end of
the hot bright day. A lamp was lighted in
the house, the happy children were talking
together, and supper was waiting. The father
and mother lingered for a moment outside
and looked down over the shadowy
fields; then they went in, without speaking.
The great day was over, and they shut the
door.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>AUNT CYNTHY DALLETT.</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c013'>I.</h3>

<p class='c010'>“No,” said Mrs. Hand, speaking wistfully,—“no,
we never were in the habit of
keeping Christmas at our house. Mother
died when we were all young; she would
have been the one to keep up with all new
ideas, but father and grandmother were old-fashioned
folks, and—well, you know how
’twas then, Miss Pendexter: nobody took
much notice of the day except to wish you a
Merry Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They didn’t do much to make it merry,
certain,” answered Miss Pendexter. “Sometimes
nowadays I hear folks complainin’ o’
bein’ overtaxed with all the Christmas work
they have to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, others think that it makes a lovely
chance for all that really enjoys givin’; you
get an opportunity to speak your kind feelin’
right out,” answered Mrs. Hand, with a
bright smile. “But there! I shall always
keep New Year’s Day, too; it won’t do no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>hurt to have an extra day kept an’ made
pleasant. And there’s many of the real old
folks have got pretty things to remember
about New Year’s Day.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aunt Cynthy Dallett’s just one of ’em,”
said Miss Pendexter. “She’s always very
reproachful if I don’t get up to see her.
Last year I missed it, on account of a light
fall o’ snow that seemed to make the walkin’
too bad, an’ she sent a neighbor’s boy ’way
down from the mount’in to see if I was
sick. Her lameness confines her to the house
altogether now, an’ I have her on my mind
a good deal. How anybody does get thinkin’
of those that lives alone, as they get older!
I waked up only last night with a start,
thinkin’ if Aunt Cynthy’s house should get
afire or anything, what she would do, ’way
up there all alone. I was half dreamin’, I
s’pose, but I couldn’t seem to settle down
until I got up an’ went upstairs to the north
garret window to see if I could see any light;
but the mountains was all dark an’ safe,
same ’s usual. I remember noticin’ last
time I was there that her chimney needed
pointin’, and I spoke to her about it,—the
bricks looked poor in some places.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you see the house from your north
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>gable window?” asked Mrs. Hand, a little
absently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes’m; it’s a great comfort that I can,”
answered her companion. “I have often
wished we were near enough to have her
make me some sort o’ signal in case she
needed help. I used to plead with her to
come down and spend the winters with me,
but she told me one day I might as well try
to fetch down one o’ the old hemlocks, an’ I
believe ’twas true.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your aunt Dallett is a very self-contained
person,” observed Mrs. Hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, very!” exclaimed the elderly niece,
with a pleased look. “Aunt Cynthy laughs,
an’ says she expects the time will come when
age ’ll compel her to have me move up an’
take care of her; and last time I was there
she looked up real funny, an’ says, ‘I do’
know, Abby; I’m most afeard sometimes
that I feel myself beginnin’ to look for’ard
to it!’ ’Twas a good deal, comin’ from
Aunt Cynthy, an’ I so esteemed it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She ought to have you there now,” said
Mrs. Hand. “You’d both make a savin’ by
doin’ it; but I don’t expect she needs to
save as much as some. There! I know just
how you both feel. I like to have my own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>home an’ do everything just my way too.”
And the friends laughed, and looked at each
other affectionately.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was old Mr. Nathan Dunn,—left
no debts an’ no money when he died,”
said Mrs. Hand. “’Twas over to his niece’s
last summer. He had a little money in his
wallet, an’ when the bill for funeral expenses
come in there was just exactly enough;
some item or other made it come to so many
dollars an’ eighty-four cents, and, lo an’ behold!
there was eighty-four cents in a little
separate pocket beside the neat fold o’ bills,
as if the old gentleman had known beforehand.
His niece couldn’t help laughin’, to
save her; she said the old gentleman died as
methodical as he lived. She didn’t expect
he had any money, an’ was prepared to pay
for everything herself; she’s very well off.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Twas funny, certain,” said Miss Pendexter.
“I expect he felt comfortable,
knowin’ he had that money by him. ’Tis a
comfort, when all ’s said and done, ‘specially
to folks that ’s gettin’ old.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A sad look shadowed her face for an instant,
and then she smiled and rose to take
leave, looking expectantly at her hostess to
see if there were anything more to be said.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>“I hope to come out square myself,” she
said, by way of farewell pleasantry; “but
there are times when I feel doubtful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Hand was evidently considering
something, and waited a moment or two before
she spoke. “Suppose we both walk up
to see your aunt Dallett, New Year’s Day, if
it ain’t too windy and the snow keeps off?”
she proposed. “I couldn’t rise the hill
if ’twas a windy day. We could take a
hearty breakfast an’ start in good season;
I’d rather walk than ride, the road’s so
rough this time o’ year.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, what a person you are to think o’
things! I did so dread goin’ ’way up there
all alone,” said Abby Pendexter. “I’m no
hand to go off alone, an’ I had it before me,
so I really got to dread it. I do so enjoy it
after I get there, seein’ Aunt Cynthy, an’
she’s always so much better than I expect to
find her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, we’ll start early,” said Mrs.
Hand cheerfully; and so they parted. As
Miss Pendexter went down the foot-path to
the gate, she sent grateful thoughts back to
the little sitting-room she had just left.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How doors are opened!” she exclaimed
to herself. “Here I’ve been so poor an’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>distressed at beginnin’ the year with nothin’,
as it were, that I couldn’t think o’ even goin’
to make poor old Aunt Cynthy a friendly
call. I’ll manage to make some kind of
a little pleasure too, an’ somethin’ for dear
Mis’ Hand. ‘Use what you’ve got,’ mother
always used to say when every sort of an
emergency come up, an’ I may only have
wishes to give, but I’ll make ’em good ones!”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>II.</h3>

<p class='c010'>The first day of the year was clear and
bright, as if it were a New Year’s pattern
of what winter can be at its very best. The
two friends were prepared for changes of
weather, and met each other well wrapped
in their winter cloaks and shawls, with sufficient
brown barége veils tied securely over
their bonnets. They ignored for some time
the plain truth that each carried something
under her arm; the shawls were rounded
out suspiciously, especially Miss Pendexter’s,
but each respected the other’s air of secrecy.
The narrow road was frozen in deep ruts,
but a smooth-trodden little foot-path that
ran along its edge was very inviting to the
wayfarers. Mrs. Hand walked first and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>Miss Pendexter followed, and they were talking
busily nearly all the way, so that they
had to stop for breath now and then at the
tops of the little hills. It was not a hard
walk; there were a good many almost level
stretches through the woods, in spite of the
fact that they should be a very great deal
higher when they reached Mrs. Dallett’s
door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do declare, what a nice day ’tis, an’
such pretty footin’!” said Mrs. Hand, with
satisfaction. “Seems to me as if my feet
went o’ themselves; gener’lly I have to toil
so when I walk that I can’t enjoy nothin’
when I get to a place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s partly this beautiful bracin’ air,”
said Abby Pendexter. “Sometimes such
nice air comes just before a fall of snow.
Don’t it seem to make anybody feel young
again and to take all your troubles away?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Hand was a comfortable, well-to-do
soul, who seldom worried about anything,
but something in her companion’s tone
touched her heart, and she glanced sidewise
and saw a pained look in Abby Pendexter’s
thin face. It was a moment for confidence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, you speak as if something distressed
your mind, Abby,” said the elder
woman kindly.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“I ain’t one that has myself on my mind
as a usual thing, but it does seem now as if
I was goin’ to have it very hard,” said Abby.
“Well, I’ve been anxious before.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it anything wrong about your property?”
Mrs. Hand ventured to ask.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Only that I ain’t got any,” answered
Abby, trying to speak gayly. “’Twas all
I could do to pay my last quarter’s rent,
twelve dollars. I sold my hens, all but this
one that had run away at the time, an’ now
I’m carryin’ her up to Aunt Cynthy, roasted
just as nice as I know how.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought you was carrying somethin’,”
said Mrs. Hand, in her usual tone. “For
me, I’ve got a couple o’ my mince pies. I
thought the old lady might like ’em; one
we can eat for our dinner, and one she shall
have to keep. But weren’t you unwise to
sacrifice your poultry, Abby? You always
need eggs, and hens don’t cost much to keep.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, yes, I shall miss ’em,” said Abby;
“but, you see, I had to do every way to get
my rent-money. Now the shop’s shut down
I haven’t got any way of earnin’ anything,
and I spent what little I’ve saved through
the summer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your aunt Cynthy ought to know it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>an’ ought to help you,” said Mrs. Hand.
“You’re a real foolish person, I must say.
I expect you do for her when she ought to
do for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She’s old, an’ she’s all the near relation
I’ve got,” said the little woman. “I’ve
always felt the time would come when she’d
need me, but it’s been her great pleasure to
live alone an’ feel free. I shall get along
somehow, but I shall have it hard. Somebody
may want help for a spell this winter,
but I’m afraid I shall have to give up my
house. ’Tain’t as if I owned it. I don’t
know just what to do, but there’ll be a way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Hand shifted her two pies to the
other arm, and stepped across to the other
side of the road where the ground looked a
little smoother.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, I wouldn’t worry if I was you,
Abby,” she said. “There, I suppose if
’twas me I should worry a good deal more!
I expect I should lay awake nights.” But
Abby answered nothing, and they came to a
steep place in the road and found another
subject for conversation at the top.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your aunt don’t know we’re coming?”
asked the chief guest of the occasion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, I never send her word,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Miss Pendexter. “She’d be so desirous to
get everything ready, just as she used to.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“She never seemed to make any trouble
o’ havin’ company; she always appeared so
easy and pleasant, and let you set with her
while she made her preparations,” said Mrs.
Hand, with great approval. “Some has
such a dreadful way of making you feel inopportune,
and you can’t always send word
you’re comin’. I did have a visit once that’s
always been a lesson to me; ’twas years ago;
I don’t know’s I ever told you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t believe you ever did,” responded
the listener to this somewhat indefinite prelude.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, ’twas one hot summer afternoon.
I set forth an’ took a great long walk ’way
over to Mis’ Eben Fulham’s, on the crossroad
between the cranberry ma’sh and Staples’s
Corner. The doctor was drivin’ that
way, an’ he give me a lift that shortened it
some at the last; but I never should have
started, if I’d known ’twas so far. I had
been promisin’ all summer to go, and every
time I saw Mis’ Fulham, Sundays, she’d say
somethin’ about it. We wa’n’t very well
acquainted, but always friendly. She moved
here from Bedford Hill.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>“Oh, yes; I used to know her,” said
Abby, with interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, now, she did give me a beautiful
welcome when I got there,” continued Mrs.
Hand. “’Twas about four o’clock in the
afternoon, an’ I told her I’d come to accept
her invitation if ’twas convenient, an’ the
doctor had been called several miles beyond
and expected to be detained, but he was goin’
to pick me up as he returned about seven;
’twas very kind of him. She took me right
in, and she did appear so pleased, an’ I must
go right into the best room where ’twas cool,
and then she said she’d have tea early, and
I should have to excuse her a short time.
I asked her not to make any difference, and
if I couldn’t assist her; but she said no, I
must just take her as I found her; and she
give me a large fan, and off she went.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There. I was glad to be still and rest
where ’twas cool, an’ I set there in the
rockin’-chair an’ enjoyed it for a while, an’
I heard her clacking at the oven door out
beyond, an’ gittin’ out some dishes. She was
a brisk-actin’ little woman, an’ I thought I’d
caution her when she come back not to make
up a great fire, only for a cup o’ tea, perhaps.
I started to go right out in the kitchen, an’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>then somethin’ told me I’d better not, we
never ’d been so free together as that; I
didn’t know how she’d take it, an’ there I
set an’ set. ’Twas sort of a greenish light
in the best room, an’ it begun to feel a little
damp to me,—the s’rubs outside grew close
up to the windows. Oh, it did seem dreadful
long! I could hear her busy with the
dishes an’ beatin’ eggs an’ stirrin’, an’ I
knew she was puttin’ herself out to get up a
great supper, and I kind o’ fidgeted about
a little an’ even stepped to the door, but I
thought she’d expect me to remain where I
was. I saw everything in that room forty
times over, an’ I did divert myself killin’
off a brood o’ moths that was in a worsted-work
mat on the table. It all fell to pieces.
I never saw such a sight o’ moths to once.
But occupation failed after that, an’ I begun
to feel sort o’ tired an’ numb. There was
one o’ them late crickets got into the room
an’ begun to chirp, an’ it sounded kind o’
fallish. I couldn’t help sayin’ to myself
that Mis’ Fulham had forgot all about my
bein’ there. I thought of all the beauties of
hospitality that ever I see!”—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Didn’t she ever come back at all, not
whilst things was in the oven, nor nothin’?”
inquired Miss Pendexter, with awe.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>“I never see her again till she come
beamin’ to the parlor door an’ invited me to
walk out to tea,” said Mrs. Hand. “’Twas
’most a quarter past six by the clock; I
thought ’twas seven. I’d thought o’ everything,
an’ I’d counted, an’ I’d trotted my
foot, an’ I’d looked more ’n twenty times to
see if there was any more moth-millers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I s’pose you did have a very nice tea?”
suggested Abby, with interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, a beautiful tea! She couldn’t have
done more if I’d been the Queen,” said Mrs.
Hand. “I don’t know how she could ever
have done it all in the time, I’m sure. The
table was loaded down; there was cup-custards
and custard pie, an’ cream pie, an’
two kinds o’ hot biscuits, an’ black tea as well
as green, an’ elegant cake,—one kind she’d
just made new, and called it quick cake; I’ve
often made it since—an’ she’d opened her
best preserves, two kinds. We set down together,
an’ I’m sure I appreciated what she’d
done; but ’twa’n’t no time for real conversation
whilst we was to the table, and before
we got quite through the doctor come hurryin’
along, an’ I had to leave. He asked us if
we’d had a good talk, as we come out, an’
I couldn’t help laughing to myself; but she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>said quite hearty that she’d had a nice visit
from me. She appeared well satisfied, Mis’
Fulham did; but for me, I was disappointed;
an’ early that fall she died.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Abby Pendexter was laughing like a girl;
the speaker’s tone had grown more and more
complaining. “I do call that a funny experience,”
she said. “‘Better a dinner o’
herbs.’ I guess that text must ha’ risen to
your mind in connection. You must tell
that to Aunt Cynthy, if conversation seems
to fail.” And she laughed again, but Mrs.
Hand still looked solemn and reproachful.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here we are; there’s Aunt Cynthy’s lane
right ahead, there by the great yellow birch,”
said Abby. “I must say, you’ve made the
way seem very short, Mis’ Hand.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>III.</h3>

<p class='c010'>Old Aunt Cynthia Dallett sat in her high-backed
rocking-chair by the little north
window, which was her favorite dwelling-place.</p>

<p class='c011'>“New Year’s Day again,” she said, aloud,—“New
Year’s Day again!” And she
folded her old bent hands, and looked out
at the great woodland view and the hills
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>without really seeing them, she was lost in
so deep a reverie. “I’m gittin’ to be very
old,” she added, after a little while.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was perfectly still in the small gray
house. Outside in the apple-trees there
were some blue-jays flitting about and calling
noisily, like schoolboys fighting at their
games. The kitchen was full of pale winter
sunshine. It was more like late October
than the first of January, and the plain little
room seemed to smile back into the sun’s
face. The outer door was standing open
into the green dooryard, and a fat small
dog lay asleep on the step. A capacious
cupboard stood behind Mrs. Dallett’s chair
and kept the wind away from her corner.
Its doors and drawers were painted a clean
lead-color, and there were places round the
knobs and buttons where the touch of hands
had worn deep into the wood. Every
braided rug was straight on the floor. The
square clock on its shelf between the front
windows looked as if it had just had its face
washed and been wound up for a whole year
to come. If Mrs. Dallett turned her head
she could look into the bedroom, where her
plump feather bed was covered with its dark
blue homespun winter quilt. It was all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>very peaceful and comfortable, but it was
very lonely. By her side, on a light-stand,
lay the religious newspaper of her denomination,
and a pair of spectacles whose jointed
silver bows looked like a funny two-legged
beetle cast helplessly upon its back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“New Year’s Day again,” said old Cynthia
Dallett. Time had left nobody in her
house to wish her a Happy New Year,—she
was the last one left in the old nest. “I’m
gittin’ to be very old,” she said for the
second time; it seemed to be all there was
to say.</p>

<p class='c011'>She was keeping a careful eye on her
friendly clock, but it was hardly past the
middle of the morning, and there was no
excuse for moving; it was the long hour
between the end of her slow morning work
and the appointed time for beginning to get
dinner. She was so stiff and lame that this
hour’s rest was usually most welcome, but
to-day she sat as if it were Sunday, and did
not take up her old shallow splint basket of
braiding-rags from the side of her footstool.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do hope Abby Pendexter ’ll make out
to git up to see me this afternoon as usual,”
she continued. “I know ’tain’t so easy for
her to get up the hill as it used to be, but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>do seem to want to see some o’ my own
folks. I wish ’t I’d thought to send her
word I expected her when Jabez Hooper
went back after he came up here with the
flour. I’d like to have had her come prepared
to stop two or three days.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A little chickadee perched on the window-sill
outside and bobbed his head sideways to
look in, and then pecked impatiently at the
glass. The old woman laughed at him with
childish pleasure and felt companioned; it
was pleasant at that moment to see the life
in even a bird’s bright eye.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sign of a stranger,” she said, as he
whisked his wings and flew away in a hurry.
“I must throw out some crumbs for ’em;
it’s getting to be hard pickin’ for the stayin’-birds.”
She looked past the trees of her
little orchard now with seeing eyes, and
followed the long forest slopes that led downward
to the lowland country. She could
see the two white steeples of Fairfield Village,
and the map of fields and pastures
along the valley beyond, and the great hills
across the valley to the westward. The
scattered houses looked like toys that had
been scattered by children. She knew their
lights by night, and watched the smoke of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>their chimneys by day. Far to the northward
were higher mountains, and these were
already white with snow. Winter was already
in sight, but to-day the wind was in
the south, and the snow seemed only part
of a great picture.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do hope the cold ’ll keep off a while
longer,” thought Mrs. Dallett. “I don’t
know how I’m going to get along after the
deep snow comes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The little dog suddenly waked, as if he
had had a bad dream, and after giving a
few anxious whines he began to bark outrageously.
His mistress tried, as usual, to
appeal to his better feelings.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tain’t nobody, Tiger,” she said. “Can’t
you have some patience? Maybe it’s some
foolish boys that’s rangin’ about with their
guns.” But Tiger kept on, and even took
the trouble to waddle in on his short legs,
barking all the way. He looked warningly
at her, and then turned and ran out again.
Then she saw him go hurrying down to the
bars, as if it were an occasion of unusual
interest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I guess somebody is comin’; he don’t
act as if ’twere a vagrant kind o’ noise;
must really be somebody in our lane.” And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>Mrs. Dallett smoothed her apron and gave
an anxious housekeeper’s glance round the
kitchen. None of her state visitors, the minister
or the deacons, ever came in the morning.
Country people are usually too busy
to go visiting in the forenoons.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently two figures appeared where the
road came out of the woods,—the two
women already known to the story, but very
surprising to Mrs. Dallett; the short, thin
one was easily recognized as Abby Pendexter,
and the taller, stout one was soon discovered
to be Mrs. Hand. Their old friend’s
heart was in a glow. As the guests approached
they could see her pale face with
its thin white hair framed under the close
black silk handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There she is at her window smilin’
away!” exclaimed Mrs. Hand; but by the
time they reached the doorstep she stood
waiting to meet them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, you two dear creatur’s!” she
said, with a beaming smile. “I don’t know
when I’ve ever been so glad to see folks
comin’. I had a kind of left-all-alone feelin’
this mornin’, an’ I didn’t even make bold
to be certain o’ you, Abby, though it looked
so pleasant. Come right in an’ set down.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>You’re all out o’ breath, ain’t you, Mis’
Hand?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Dallett led the way with eager
hospitality. She was the tiniest little bent
old creature, her handkerchiefed head was
quick and alert, and her eyes were bright
with excitement and feeling, but the rest of
her was much the worse for age; she could
hardly move, poor soul, as if she had only
a make-believe framework of a body under
a shoulder-shawl and thick petticoats. She
got back to her chair again, and the guests
took off their bonnets in the bedroom, and
returned discreet and sedate in their black
woolen dresses. The lonely kitchen was
blest with society at last, to its mistress’s
heart’s content. They talked as fast as
possible about the weather, and how warm
it had been walking up the mountain, and
how cold it had been a year ago, that day
when Abby Pendexter had been kept at
home by a snowstorm and missed her visit.
“And I ain’t seen you now, aunt, since
the twenty-eighth of September, but I’ve
thought of you a great deal, and looked forward
to comin’ more ’n usual,” she ended,
with an affectionate glance at the pleased
old face by the window.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>“I’ve been wantin’ to see you, dear, and
wonderin’ how you was gettin’ on,” said
Aunt Cynthy kindly. “And I take it as
a great attention to have you come to-day,
Mis’ Hand,” she added, turning again towards
the more distinguished guest. “We
have to put one thing against another.
I should hate dreadfully to live anywhere
except on a high hill farm, ‘cordin’ as I was
born an’ raised. But there ain’t the chance
to neighbor that townfolks has, an’ I do
seem to have more lonely hours than I used
to when I was younger. I don’t know but I
shall soon be gittin’ too old to live alone.”
And she turned to her niece with an expectant,
lovely look, and Abby smiled back.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I often wish I could run in an’ see you
every day, aunt,” she answered. “I have
been sayin’ so to Mrs. Hand.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There, how anybody does relish company
when they don’t have but a little of
it!” exclaimed Aunt Cynthia. “I am all
alone to-day; there is going to be a shootin’-match
somewhere the other side o’ the mountain,
an’ Johnny Foss, that does my chores,
begged off to go when he brought the milk
unusual early this mornin’. Gener’lly he’s
about here all the fore part of the day; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>he don’t go off with the boys very often, and
I like to have him have a little sport; ’twas
New Year’s Day, anyway; he’s a good,
stiddy boy for my wants.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I wish you Happy New Year,
aunt!” said Abby, springing up with unusual
spirit. “Why, that’s just what we
come to say, and we like to have forgot all
about it!” She kissed her aunt, and stood
a minute holding her hand with a soft,
affectionate touch. Mrs. Hand rose and
kissed Mrs. Dallett too, and it was a moment
of ceremony and deep feeling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I always like to keep the day,” said the
old hostess, as they seated themselves and
drew their splint-bottomed chairs a little
nearer together than before. “You see, I
was brought up to it, and father made a
good deal of it; he said he liked to make
it pleasant and give the year a fair start. I
can see him now, how he used to be standing
there by the fireplace when we came out
o’ the two bedrooms early in the morning,
an’ he always made out, poor ’s he was, to
give us some little present, and he’d heap
’em up on the corner o’ the mantelpiece,
an’ we’d stand front of him in a row, and
mother be bustling about gettin’ breakfast.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>One year he give me a beautiful copy o’
the ‘Life o’ General Lafayette,’ in a green
cover,—I’ve got it now, but we child’n
’bout read it to pieces,—an’ one year a
nice piece o’ blue ribbon, an’ Abby—that
was your mother, Abby—had a pink one.
Father was real kind to his child’n. I
thought o’ them early days when I first
waked up this mornin’, and I couldn’t help
lookin’ up then to the corner o’ the shelf
just as I used to look.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“There’s nothin’ so beautiful as to have
a bright childhood to look back to,” said
Mrs. Hand. “Sometimes I think child’n
has too hard a time now,—all the responsibility
is put on to ’em, since they take the
lead o’ what to do an’ what they want, and
get to be so toppin’ an’ knowin’. ’Twas
happier in the old days, when the fathers
an’ mothers done the rulin’.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They say things have changed,” said
Aunt Cynthy; “but staying right here, I
don’t know much of any world but my own
world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Abby Pendexter did not join in this conversation,
but sat in her straight-backed
chair with folded hands and the air of a
good child. The little old dog had followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>her in, and now lay sound asleep again at
her feet. The front breadth of her black
dress looked rusty and old in the sunshine
that slanted across it, and the aunt’s sharp
eyes saw this and saw the careful darns.
Abby was as neat as wax, but she looked as
if the frost had struck her. “I declare,
she’s gittin’ along in years,” thought Aunt
Cynthia compassionately. “She begins to
look sort o’ set and dried up, Abby does.
She oughtn’t to live all alone; she’s one
that needs company.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this moment Abby looked up with
new interest. “Now, aunt,” she said, in her
pleasant voice, “I don’t want you to forget
to tell me if there ain’t some sewin’ or
mendin’ I can do whilst I’m here. I know
your hands trouble you some, an’ I may ’s
well tell you we’re bent on stayin’ all day
an’ makin’ a good visit, Mis’ Hand an’ me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank ye kindly,” said the old woman;
“I do want a little sewin’ done before long,
but ’tain’t no use to spile a good holiday.”
Her face took a resolved expression. “I’m
goin’ to make other arrangements,” she
said. “No, you needn’t come up here to
pass New Year’s Day an’ be put right down
to sewin’. I make out to do what mendin’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>I need, an’ to sew on my hooks an’ eyes. I
get Johnny Ross to thread me up a good
lot o’ needles every little while, an’ that
helps me a good deal. Abby, why can’t
you step into the best room an’ bring out
the rockin’-chair? I seem to want Mis’
Hand to have it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I opened the window to let the sun in
awhile,” said the niece, as she returned.
“It felt cool in there an’ shut up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thought of doin’ it not long before you
come,” said Mrs. Dallett, looking gratified.
Once the taking of such a liberty would
have been very provoking to her. “Why,
it does seem good to have somebody think
o’ things an’ take right hold like that!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m sure you would, if you were down
at my house,” said Abby, blushing. “Aunt
Cynthy, I don’t suppose you could feel as
if ’twould be best to come down an’ pass
the winter with me,—just durin’ the cold
weather, I mean. You’d see more folks
to amuse you, an’—I do think of you so
anxious these long winter nights.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a terrible silence in the room,
and Miss Pendexter felt her heart begin to
beat very fast. She did not dare to look at
her aunt at first.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>Presently the silence was broken. Aunt
Cynthia had been gazing out of the window,
and she turned towards them a little
paler and older than before, and smiling
sadly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, dear, I’ll do just as you say,” she
answered. “I’m beat by age at last, but
I’ve had my own way for eighty-five years,
come the month o’ March, an’ last winter I
did use to lay awake an’ worry in the long
storms. I’m kind o’ humble now about
livin’ alone to what I was once.” At this
moment a new light shone in her face. “I
don’t expect you’d be willin’ to come up
here an’ stay till spring,—not if I had
Foss’s folks stop for you to ride to meetin’
every pleasant Sunday, an’ take you down to
the Corners plenty o’ other times besides?”
she said beseechingly. “No, Abby, I’m
too old to move now; I should be homesick
down to the village. If you’ll come an’
stay with me, all I have shall be yours.
Mis’ Hand hears me say it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, don’t you think o’ that; you’re all
I’ve got near to me in the world, an’ I’ll
come an’ welcome,” said Abby, though the
thought of her own little home gave a hard
tug at her heart. “Yes, Aunt Cynthy, I’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>come, an’ we’ll be real comfortable together.
I’ve been lonesome sometimes”—</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Twill be best for both,” said Mrs.
Hand judicially. And so the great question
was settled, and suddenly, without too
much excitement, it became a thing of the
past.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We must be thinkin’ o’ dinner,” said
Aunt Cynthia gayly. “I wish I was better
prepared; but there’s nice eggs an’ pork
an’ potatoes, an’ you girls can take hold an’
help.” At this moment the roast chicken
and the best mince pies were offered and
kindly accepted, and before another hour
had gone they were sitting at their New
Year feast, which Mrs. Dallett decided to
be quite proper for the Queen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before the guests departed, when the sun
was getting low, Aunt Cynthia called her
niece to her side and took hold of her hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t you make it too long now, Abby,”
said she. “I shall be wantin’ ye every day
till you come; but you mustn’t forgit what
a set old thing I be.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Abby had the kindest of hearts, and was
always longing for somebody to love and
care for; her aunt’s very age and helplessness
seemed to beg for pity.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>“This is Saturday; you may expect me the
early part of the week; and thank you, too,
aunt,” said Abby.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mrs. Hand stood by with deep sympathy.
“It’s the proper thing,” she announced
calmly. “You’d both of you be a sight
happier; and truth is, Abby’s wild an’
reckless, an’ needs somebody to stand right
over her, Mis’ Dallett. I guess she’ll try an’
behave, but there—there’s no knowin’!”
And they all laughed. Then the New Year
guests said farewell and started off down
the mountain road. They looked back more
than once to see Aunt Cynthia’s face at the
window as she watched them out of sight.
Miss Abby Pendexter was full of excitement;
she looked as happy as a child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I feel as if we’d gained the battle of
Waterloo,” said Mrs. Hand. “I’ve really
had a most beautiful time. You an’ your
aunt mustn’t forgit to invite me up some
time again to spend another day.”</p>
